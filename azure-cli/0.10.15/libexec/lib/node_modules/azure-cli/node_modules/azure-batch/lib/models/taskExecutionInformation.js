/**
 * @class
 * Initializes a new instance of the TaskExecutionInformation class.
 * @constructor
 * @summary Information about the execution of a task.
 *
 * @member {date} [startTime] The time at which the task started running. If
 * the task has been restarted or retried, this is the most recent time at
 * which the task started running.
 * 
 * @member {date} [endTime] The time at which the task completed. This
 * property is set only if the task is in the Completed state.
 * 
 * @member {number} [exitCode] The exit code of the program specified on the
 * task command line. This parameter is returned only if the task is in the
 * completed state. The exit code for a process reflects the specific
 * convention implemented by the application developer for that process. If
 * you use the exit code value to make decisions in your code, be sure that
 * you know the exit code convention used by the application process. Note
 * that the exit code may also be generated by the compute node operating
 * system, such as when a process is forcibly terminated.
 * 
 * @member {object} [schedulingError] Details of any error encountered
 * scheduling the task.
 * 
 * @member {string} [schedulingError.category] Possible values include:
 * 'usererror', 'servererror', 'unmapped'
 * 
 * @member {string} [schedulingError.code]
 * 
 * @member {string} [schedulingError.message]
 * 
 * @member {array} [schedulingError.details]
 * 
 * @member {number} retryCount The number of times the task has been retried
 * by the Batch service.
 * 
 * @member {date} [lastRetryTime] The most recent time at which a retry of the
 * task started running.
 * 
 * @member {number} requeueCount The number of times the task has been
 * requeued by the Batch service as the result of a user request.
 * 
 * @member {date} [lastRequeueTime] The most recent time at which the task has
 * been requeued by the Batch service as the result of a user request.
