[About EPSILON]

    EPSILON is a powerful OpenSource wavelet image compressor.
    Wavelet-driven compressors are know to be much more effective
    than traditional DCT-based ones (like JPEG). At the moment,
    the program supports 30+ different wavelet filters, runs
    in parallel in multi-threaded and MPI environments, can
    process HUGE images and much more!
