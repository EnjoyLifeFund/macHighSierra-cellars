[TODO list]

Nearest plans include:

- More extensive testing of platforms other than Linux: *BSD,
  Solaris, OSX, Windows etc. If you succeed in building EPSILON
  on these systems please drop me an email.

- Extending test suite. As of release 0.9.1 EPSILON has a flexible
  testing framework written in Perl. At the moment of writing test
  suite consists of two tests: complete verification test (all build
  types, all filters, all block sizes all applicable modes etc.) and
  quick check.

- Try using CUDA in computation extensive parts.

- Extend documentation, write tutorials.
