  # This patch addresses a bug discovered in the HidApi IOHidManager back-end
  # that is being used with Macs.
  # The bug was dramatically changing the behaviour of the function
  # "hid_get_feature_report". As a consequence, many applications working
  # with HidApi were not behaving correctly on OSX.
  # pull request on Hidapi's repo: https://github.com/signal11/hidapi/pull/219
