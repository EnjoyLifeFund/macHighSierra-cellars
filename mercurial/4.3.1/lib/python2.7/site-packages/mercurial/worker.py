    The current strategy takes every Nth element from the input. If
    we ever write workers that need to preserve grouping in input
    we should consider allowing callers to specify a partition strategy.

    mpm is not a fan of this partitioning strategy when files are involved.
    In his words:

        Single-threaded Mercurial makes a point of creating and visiting
        files in a fixed order (alphabetical). When creating files in order,
        a typical filesystem is likely to allocate them on nearby regions on
        disk. Thus, when revisiting in the same order, locality is maximized
        and various forms of OS and disk-level caching and read-ahead get a
        chance to work.

        This effect can be quite significant on spinning disks. I discovered it
        circa Mercurial v0.4 when revlogs were named by hashes of filenames.
        Tarring a repo and copying it to another disk effectively randomized
        the revlog ordering on disk by sorting the revlogs by hash and suddenly
        performance of my kernel checkout benchmark dropped by ~10x because the
        "working set" of sectors visited no longer fit in the drive's cache and
        the workload switched from streaming to random I/O.

        What we should really be doing is have workers read filenames from a
        ordered queue. This preserves locality and also keeps any worker from
        getting more than one file out of balance.
