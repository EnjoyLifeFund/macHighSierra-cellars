.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The Mercurial system uses a set of configuration files to control
aspects of its behavior.
.SH TROUBLESHOOTING
.sp
If you\(aqre having problems with your configuration,
\%\fBhg config \-\-debug\fP\: can help you understand what is introducing
a setting into your environment.
.sp
See \%\fBhg help config.syntax\fP\: and \%\fBhg help config.files\fP\:
for information about how and where to override things.
.SH STRUCTURE
.sp
The configuration files use a simple ini\-file format. A configuration
file consists of sections, led by a \fB[section]\fP header and followed
by \fBname = value\fP entries:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[ui]
username = Firstname Lastname <firstname.lastname@example.net>
verbose = True
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The above entries will be referred to as \fBui.username\fP and
\fBui.verbose\fP, respectively. See \%\fBhg help config.syntax\fP\:.
.SH FILES
.sp
Mercurial reads configuration data from several files, if they exist.
These files do not exist by default and you will have to create the
appropriate configuration files yourself:
.sp
Local configuration is put into the per\-repository \fB<repo>/.hg/hgrc\fP file.
.sp
Global configuration like the username setting is typically put into:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
\fB%USERPROFILE%\emercurial.ini\fP (on Windows)
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
\fB$HOME/.hgrc\fP (on Unix, Plan9)
.UNINDENT
.sp
The names of these files depend on the system on which Mercurial is
installed. \fB*.rc\fP files from a single directory are read in
alphabetical order, later ones overriding earlier ones. Where multiple
paths are given below, settings from earlier paths override later
ones.
.sp
On Unix, the following files are consulted:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
\fB<repo>/.hg/hgrc\fP (per\-repository)
.IP \(bu 2

.UNINDENT
.sp
Per\-repository configuration options only apply in a
particular repository. This file is not version\-controlled, and
will not get transferred during a "clone" operation. Options in
this file override options in all other configuration files.
.sp
On Plan 9 and Unix, most of this file will be ignored if it doesn\(aqt
belong to a trusted user or to a trusted group. See
\%\fBhg help config.trusted\fP\: for more details.
.sp
Per\-user configuration file(s) are for the user running Mercurial.  Options
in these files apply to all Mercurial commands executed by this user in any
directory. Options in these files override per\-system and per\-installation
options.
.sp
Per\-installation configuration files are searched for in the
directory where Mercurial is installed. \fB<install\-root>\fP is the
parent directory of the \fBhg\fP executable (or symlink) being run.
.sp
For example, if installed in \fB/shared/tools/bin/hg\fP, Mercurial
will look in \fB/shared/tools/etc/mercurial/hgrc\fP. Options in these
files apply to all Mercurial commands executed by any user in any
directory.
.sp
Per\-installation configuration files are for the system on
which Mercurial is running. Options in these files apply to all
Mercurial commands executed by any user in any directory. Registry
keys contain PATH\-like strings, every part of which must reference
a \fBMercurial.ini\fP file or be a directory where \fB*.rc\fP files will
be read.  Mercurial checks each of these locations in the specified
order until one or more configuration files are detected.
.sp
Per\-system configuration files are for the system on which Mercurial
is running. Options in these files apply to all Mercurial commands
executed by any user in any directory. Options in these files
override per\-installation options.
.sp
Mercurial comes with some default configuration. The default configuration
files are installed with Mercurial and will be overwritten on upgrades. Default
configuration files should never be edited by users or administrators but can
be overridden in other configuration files. So far the directory only contains
merge tool configuration but packagers can also put other default configuration
there.
.SH SYNTAX
.sp
A configuration file consists of sections, led by a \fB[section]\fP header
and followed by \fBname = value\fP entries (sometimes called
\fBconfiguration keys\fP):
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[spam]
eggs=ham
green=
   eggs
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Each line contains one entry. If the lines that follow are indented,
they are treated as continuations of that entry. Leading whitespace is
removed from values. Empty lines are skipped. Lines beginning with
\fB#\fP or \fB;\fP are ignored and may be used to provide comments.
.sp
Configuration keys can be set multiple times, in which case Mercurial
will use the value that was configured last. As an example:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[spam]
eggs=large
ham=serrano
eggs=small
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This would set the configuration key named \fBeggs\fP to \fBsmall\fP.
.sp
It is also possible to define a section multiple times. A section can
be redefined on the same and/or on different configuration files. For
example:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[foo]
eggs=large
ham=serrano
eggs=small

[bar]
eggs=ham
green=
   eggs

[foo]
ham=prosciutto
eggs=medium
bread=toasted
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This would set the \fBeggs\fP, \fBham\fP, and \fBbread\fP configuration keys
of the \fBfoo\fP section to \fBmedium\fP, \fBprosciutto\fP, and \fBtoasted\fP,
respectively. As you can see there only thing that matters is the last
value that was set for each of the configuration keys.
.sp
If a configuration key is set multiple times in different
configuration files the final value will depend on the order in which
the different configuration files are read, with settings from earlier
paths overriding later ones as described on the \fBFiles\fP section
above.
.sp
A line of the form \fB%include file\fP will include \fBfile\fP into the
current configuration file. The inclusion is recursive, which means
that included files can include other files. Filenames are relative to
the configuration file in which the \fB%include\fP directive is found.
Environment variables and \fB~user\fP constructs are expanded in
\fBfile\fP. This lets you do something like:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
%include ~/.hgrc.d/$HOST.rc
.ft P
.fi
.sp
to include a different configuration file on each computer you use.
.sp
A line with \fB%unset name\fP will remove \fBname\fP from the current
section, if it has been set previously.
.sp
The values are either free\-form text strings, lists of text strings,
or Boolean values. Boolean values can be set to true using any of "1",
"yes", "true", or "on" and to false using "0", "no", "false", or "off"
(all case insensitive).
.sp
List values are separated by whitespace or comma, except when values are
placed in double quotation marks:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
allow_read = "John Doe, PhD", brian, betty
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Quotation marks can be escaped by prefixing them with a backslash. Only
quotation marks at the beginning of a word is counted as a quotation
(e.g., \fBfoo"bar baz\fP is the list of \fBfoo"bar\fP and \fBbaz\fP).
.SH SECTIONS
.sp
This section describes the different sections that may appear in a
Mercurial configuration file, the purpose of each section, its possible
keys, and their possible values.
.SS \fBalias\fP
.sp
Defines command aliases.
.sp
Aliases allow you to define your own commands in terms of other
commands (or aliases), optionally including arguments. Positional
arguments in the form of \fB$1\fP, \fB$2\fP, etc. in the alias definition
are expanded by Mercurial before execution. Positional arguments not
already used by \fB$N\fP in the definition are put at the end of the
command to be executed.
.sp
Alias definitions consist of lines of the form:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
<alias> = <command> [<argument>]...
.ft P
.fi
.sp
For example, this definition:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
latest = log \-\-limit 5
.ft P
.fi
.sp
creates a new command \fBlatest\fP that shows only the five most recent
changesets. You can define subsequent aliases using earlier ones:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
stable5 = latest \-b stable
.ft P
.fi
.IP Note
.
It is possible to create aliases with the same names as
existing commands, which will then override the original
definitions. This is almost always a bad idea!
.RE
.sp
An alias can start with an exclamation point (\fB!\fP) to make it a
shell alias. A shell alias is executed with the shell and will let you
run arbitrary commands. As an example,
.sp
.nf
.ft C
echo = !echo $@
.ft P
.fi
.sp
will let you do \fBhg echo foo\fP to have \fBfoo\fP printed in your
terminal. A better example might be:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
purge = !$HG status \-\-no\-status \-\-unknown \-0 re: | xargs \-0 rm \-f
.ft P
.fi
.sp
which will make \fBhg purge\fP delete all unknown files in the
repository in the same manner as the purge extension.
.sp
Positional arguments like \fB$1\fP, \fB$2\fP, etc. in the alias definition
expand to the command arguments. Unmatched arguments are
removed. \fB$0\fP expands to the alias name and \fB$@\fP expands to all
arguments separated by a space. \fB"$@"\fP (with quotes) expands to all
arguments quoted individually and separated by a space. These expansions
happen before the command is passed to the shell.
.sp
Shell aliases are executed in an environment where \fB$HG\fP expands to
the path of the Mercurial that was used to execute the alias. This is
useful when you want to call further Mercurial commands in a shell
alias, as was done above for the purge alias. In addition,
\fB$HG_ARGS\fP expands to the arguments given to Mercurial. In the \fBhg
echo foo\fP call above, \fB$HG_ARGS\fP would expand to \fBecho foo\fP.
.IP Note
.
Some global configuration options such as \fB\-R\fP are
processed before shell aliases and will thus not be passed to
aliases.
.RE
.SS \fBannotate\fP
.sp
Settings used when displaying file annotations. All values are
Booleans and default to False. See \%\fBhg help config.diff\fP\: for
related options for the diff command.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBignorews\fP
.sp
Ignore white space when comparing lines.
.TP
.B \fBignorewsamount\fP
.sp
Ignore changes in the amount of white space.
.TP
.B \fBignoreblanklines\fP
.sp
Ignore changes whose lines are all blank.
.UNINDENT
.SS \fBauth\fP
.sp
Authentication credentials and other authentication\-like configuration
for HTTP connections. This section allows you to store usernames and
passwords for use when logging \fIinto\fP HTTP servers. See
\%\fBhg help config.web\fP\: if you want to configure \fIwho\fP can login to
your HTTP server.
.sp
The following options apply to all hosts.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBcookiefile\fP
.sp
Path to a file containing HTTP cookie lines. Cookies matching a
host will be sent automatically.
.sp
The file format uses the Mozilla cookies.txt format, which defines cookies
on their own lines. Each line contains 7 fields delimited by the tab
character (domain, is_domain_cookie, path, is_secure, expires, name,
value). For more info, do an Internet search for "Netscape cookies.txt
format."
.sp
Note: the cookies parser does not handle port numbers on domains. You
will need to remove ports from the domain for the cookie to be recognized.
This could result in a cookie being disclosed to an unwanted server.
.sp
The cookies file is read\-only.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Other options in this section are grouped by name and have the following
format:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
<name>.<argument> = <value>
.ft P
.fi
.sp
where \fB<name>\fP is used to group arguments into authentication
entries. Example:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
foo.prefix = hg.intevation.de/mercurial
foo.username = foo
foo.password = bar
foo.schemes = http https

bar.prefix = secure.example.org
bar.key = path/to/file.key
bar.cert = path/to/file.cert
bar.schemes = https
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Supported arguments:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBprefix\fP
.sp
Either \fB*\fP or a URI prefix with or without the scheme part.
The authentication entry with the longest matching prefix is used
(where \fB*\fP matches everything and counts as a match of length
1). If the prefix doesn\(aqt include a scheme, the match is performed
against the URI with its scheme stripped as well, and the schemes
argument, q.v., is then subsequently consulted.
.TP
.B \fBusername\fP
.sp
Optional. Username to authenticate with. If not given, and the
remote site requires basic or digest authentication, the user will
be prompted for it. Environment variables are expanded in the
username letting you do \fBfoo.username = $USER\fP. If the URI
includes a username, only \fB[auth]\fP entries with a matching
username or without a username will be considered.
.TP
.B \fBpassword\fP
.sp
Optional. Password to authenticate with. If not given, and the
remote site requires basic or digest authentication, the user
will be prompted for it.
.TP
.B \fBkey\fP
.sp
Optional. PEM encoded client certificate key file. Environment
variables are expanded in the filename.
.TP
.B \fBcert\fP
.sp
Optional. PEM encoded client certificate chain file. Environment
variables are expanded in the filename.
.TP
.B \fBschemes\fP
.sp
Optional. Space separated list of URI schemes to use this
authentication entry with. Only used if the prefix doesn\(aqt include
a scheme. Supported schemes are http and https. They will match
static\-http and static\-https respectively, as well.
(default: https)
.UNINDENT
.sp
If no suitable authentication entry is found, the user is prompted
for credentials as usual if required by the remote.
.SS \fBcolor\fP
.sp
Configure the Mercurial color mode. For details about how to define your custom
effect and style see \%\fBhg help color\fP\:.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBmode\fP
.sp
String: control the method used to output color. One of \fBauto\fP, \fBansi\fP,
\fBwin32\fP, \fBterminfo\fP or \fBdebug\fP. In auto mode, Mercurial will
use ANSI mode by default (or win32 mode prior to Windows 10) if it detects a
terminal. Any invalid value will disable color.
.TP
.B \fBpagermode\fP
.sp
String: optional override of \fBcolor.mode\fP used with pager.
.sp
On some systems, terminfo mode may cause problems when using
color with \fBless \-R\fP as a pager program. less with the \-R option
will only display ECMA\-48 color codes, and terminfo mode may sometimes
emit codes that less doesn\(aqt understand. You can work around this by
either using ansi mode (or auto mode), or by using less \-r (which will
pass through all terminal control codes, not just color control
codes).
.sp
On some systems (such as MSYS in Windows), the terminal may support
a different color mode than the pager program.
.UNINDENT
.SS \fBcommands\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBstatus.relative\fP
.sp
Make paths in \%\fBhg status\fP\: output relative to the current directory.
(default: False)
.TP
.B \fBupdate.requiredest\fP
.sp
Require that the user pass a destination when running \%\fBhg update\fP\:.
For example, \%\fBhg update .::\fP\: will be allowed, but a plain \%\fBhg update\fP\:
will be disallowed.
(default: False)
.UNINDENT
.SS \fBcommittemplate\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBchangeset\fP
.sp
String: configuration in this section is used as the template to
customize the text shown in the editor when committing.
.UNINDENT
.sp
In addition to pre\-defined template keywords, commit log specific one
below can be used for customization:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBextramsg\fP
.sp
String: Extra message (typically \(aqLeave message empty to abort
commit.\(aq). This may be changed by some commands or extensions.
.UNINDENT
.sp
For example, the template configuration below shows as same text as
one shown by default:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[committemplate]
changeset = {desc}\en\en
    HG: Enter commit message.  Lines beginning with \(aqHG:\(aq are removed.
    HG: {extramsg}
    HG: \-\-
    HG: user: {author}\en{ifeq(p2rev, "\-1", "",
   "HG: branch merge\en")
   }HG: branch \(aq{branch}\(aq\en{if(activebookmark,
   "HG: bookmark \(aq{activebookmark}\(aq\en")   }{subrepos %
   "HG: subrepo {subrepo}\en"              }{file_adds %
   "HG: added {file}\en"                   }{file_mods %
   "HG: changed {file}\en"                 }{file_dels %
   "HG: removed {file}\en"                 }{if(files, "",
   "HG: no files changed\en")}
.ft P
.fi
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBdiff()\fP
.sp
String: show the diff (see \%\fBhg help templates\fP\: for detail)
.UNINDENT
.sp
Sometimes it is helpful to show the diff of the changeset in the editor without
having to prefix \(aqHG: \(aq to each line so that highlighting works correctly. For
this, Mercurial provides a special string which will ignore everything below
it:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
HG: \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- >8 \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
.ft P
.fi
.sp
For example, the template configuration below will show the diff below the
extra message:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[committemplate]
changeset = {desc}\en\en
    HG: Enter commit message.  Lines beginning with \(aqHG:\(aq are removed.
    HG: {extramsg}
    HG: \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- >8 \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
    HG: Do not touch the line above.
    HG: Everything below will be removed.
    {diff()}
.ft P
.fi
.IP Note
.
For some problematic encodings (see \%\fBhg help win32mbcs\fP\: for
detail), this customization should be configured carefully, to
avoid showing broken characters.
.sp
For example, if a multibyte character ending with backslash (0x5c) is
followed by the ASCII character \(aqn\(aq in the customized template,
the sequence of backslash and \(aqn\(aq is treated as line\-feed unexpectedly
(and the multibyte character is broken, too).

These dot\-separated lists of names are treated as hierarchical ones.
For example, \fBchangeset.tag.remove\fP customizes the commit message
only for \%\fBhg tag \-\-remove\fP\:, but \fBchangeset.tag\fP customizes the
commit message for \%\fBhg tag\fP\: regardless of \fB\-\-remove\fP option.
.sp
When the external editor is invoked for a commit, the corresponding
dot\-separated list of names without the \fBchangeset.\fP prefix
(e.g. \fBcommit.normal.normal\fP) is in the \fBHGEDITFORM\fP environment
variable.

.SS \fBdecode/encode\fP
.sp
Filters for transforming files on checkout/checkin. This would
typically be used for newline processing or other
localization/canonicalization of files.
.sp
Filters consist of a filter pattern followed by a filter command.
Filter patterns are globs by default, rooted at the repository root.
For example, to match any file ending in \fB.txt\fP in the root
directory only, use the pattern \fB*.txt\fP. To match any file ending
in \fB.c\fP anywhere in the repository, use the pattern \fB**.c\fP.
For each file only the first matching filter applies.
.sp
The filter command can start with a specifier, either \fBpipe:\fP or
\fBtempfile:\fP. If no specifier is given, \fBpipe:\fP is used by default.
.sp
A \fBpipe:\fP command must accept data on stdin and return the transformed
data on stdout.
.sp
Pipe example:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[encode]
# uncompress gzip files on checkin to improve delta compression
# note: not necessarily a good idea, just an example
*.gz = pipe: gunzip

[decode]
# recompress gzip files when writing them to the working dir (we
# can safely omit "pipe:", because it\(aqs the default)
*.gz = gzip
.ft P
.fi
.sp
A \fBtempfile:\fP command is a template. The string \fBINFILE\fP is replaced
with the name of a temporary file that contains the data to be
filtered by the command. The string \fBOUTFILE\fP is replaced with the name
of an empty temporary file, where the filtered data must be written by
the command.
.IP Note
.
The tempfile mechanism is recommended for Windows systems,
where the standard shell I/O redirection operators often have
strange effects and may corrupt the contents of your files.
.RE
.sp
This filter mechanism is used internally by the \fBeol\fP extension to
translate line ending characters between Windows (CRLF) and Unix (LF)
format. We suggest you use the \fBeol\fP extension for convenience.
.SS \fBdefaults\fP
.sp
(defaults are deprecated. Don\(aqt use them. Use aliases instead.)

Mercurial has an extension mechanism for adding new features. To
enable an extension, create an entry for it in this section.
.sp
If you know that the extension is already in Python\(aqs search path,
you can give the name of the module, followed by \fB=\fP, with nothing
after the \fB=\fP.
.sp
Otherwise, give a name that you choose, followed by \fB=\fP, followed by
the path to the \fB.py\fP file (including the file name extension) that
defines the extension.
.sp
To explicitly disable an extension that is enabled in an hgrc of
broader scope, prepend its path with \fB!\fP, as in \fBfoo = !/ext/path\fP
or \fBfoo = !\fP when path is not supplied.
.sp
Example for \fB~/.hgrc\fP:
.sp

Commands or Python functions that get automatically executed by
various actions such as starting or finishing a commit. Multiple

Parent changeset IDs are in \fB$HG_PARENT1\fP and \fB$HG_PARENT2\fP.
.TP
.B \fBprelistkeys\fP
.sp
Run before listing pushkeys (like bookmarks) in the

in \fB$HG_NAMESPACE\fP.
.TP
.B \fBpreoutgoing\fP
.sp
Run before collecting changes to send from the local repository to
another. A non\-zero status will cause failure. This lets you prevent
pull over HTTP or SSH. It can also prevent propagating commits (via
local pull, push (outbound) or bundle commands), but not completely,
since you can just copy files instead. The source of operation is in
\fB$HG_SOURCE\fP. If "serve", the operation is happening on behalf of a remote
SSH or HTTP repository. If "push", "pull" or "bundle", the operation
is happening on behalf of a repository on same system.
.TP
.B \fBprepushkey\fP
.sp
Run before a pushkey (like a bookmark) is added to the

transaction will be in \fBHG_TXNID\fP. A non\-zero status will prevent the
transaction from being opened.
.TP
.B \fBpretxnclose\fP
.sp
Run right before the transaction is actually finalized. Any repository change

content or change it. Exit status 0 allows the commit to proceed. A non\-zero
status will cause the transaction to be rolled back. The reason for the
transaction opening will be in \fB$HG_TXNNAME\fP, and a unique identifier for
the transaction will be in \fBHG_TXNID\fP. The rest of the available data will
vary according the transaction type. New changesets will add \fB$HG_NODE\fP
(the ID of the first added changeset), \fB$HG_NODE_LAST\fP (the ID of the last
added changeset), \fB$HG_URL\fP and \fB$HG_SOURCE\fP variables.  Bookmark and

It is generally better to use standard hooks rather than the
generic pre\- and post\- command hooks, as they are guaranteed to be
called in the appropriate contexts for influencing transactions.
Also, hooks like "commit" will be called in all contexts that
generate a commit (e.g. tag) and not just the commit command.

Environment variables with empty values may not be passed to

.sp
.nf
.ft C
hookname = python:modulename.submodule.callable
hookname = python:/path/to/python/module.py:callable
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Python hooks are run within the Mercurial process. Each hook is
called with at least three keyword arguments: a ui object (keyword
\fBui\fP), a repository object (keyword \fBrepo\fP), and a \fBhooktype\fP
keyword that tells what kind of hook is used. Arguments listed as
environment variables above are passed as keyword arguments, with no

.SS \fBhostfingerprints\fP
.sp
(Deprecated. Use \fB[hostsecurity]\fP\(aqs \fBfingerprints\fP options instead.)
.sp
Fingerprints of the certificates of known HTTPS servers.
.sp
A HTTPS connection to a server with a fingerprint configured here will
only succeed if the servers certificate matches the fingerprint.
This is very similar to how ssh known hosts works.
.sp
The fingerprint is the SHA\-1 hash value of the DER encoded certificate.
Multiple values can be specified (separated by spaces or commas). This can
be used to define both old and new fingerprints while a host transitions
to a new certificate.
.sp
The CA chain and web.cacerts is not used for servers with a fingerprint.
.sp
For example:
.sp
.nf
.ft C

.sp
Allowed values are: \fBtls1.0\fP, \fBtls1.1\fP, \fBtls1.2\fP.

When running on an old Python version, only \fBtls1.0\fP is allowed since
old versions of Python only support up to TLS 1.0.
.sp
When running a Python that supports modern TLS versions, the default is
\fBtls1.1\fP. \fBtls1.0\fP can still be used to allow TLS 1.0. However, this

In addition, colons (\fB:\fP) can appear in the fingerprint part.
.sp
The following algorithms/prefixes are supported: \fBsha1\fP, \fBsha256\fP,
\fBsha512\fP.
.sp
Use of \fBsha256\fP or \fBsha512\fP is preferred.
.sp
If a fingerprint is specified, the CA chain is not validated for this
host and Mercurial will require the remote certificate to match one
of the fingerprints specified. This means if the server updates its
certificate, Mercurial will abort until a new fingerprint is defined.
This can provide stronger security than traditional CA\-based validation
at the expense of convenience.
.sp
This option takes precedence over \fBverifycertsfile\fP.

.TP
.B \fBverifycertsfile\fP

.sp
The server certificate or the certificate\(aqs certificate authority (CA)

will fail and connections to the server will be refused.
.sp
If defined, only certificates provided by this file will be used:
\fBweb.cacerts\fP and any system/default certificates will not be

variables: \fB$base\fP, \fB$local\fP, \fB$other\fP, \fB$output\fP. The meaning
of \fB$local\fP and \fB$other\fP can vary depending on which action is being
performed. During and update or merge, \fB$local\fP represents the original
state of the file, while \fB$other\fP represents the commit you are updating
to or the commit you are merging with. During a rebase \fB$local\fP
represents the destination of the rebase, and \fB$other\fP represents the
commit being rebased.
(default: \fB$local $base $other\fP)

.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBregkey\fP
.sp
Windows registry key which describes install location of this
tool. Mercurial will search for this key first under
\fBHKEY_CURRENT_USER\fP and then under \fBHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\fP.
(default: None)
.TP
.B \fBregkeyalt\fP
.sp
An alternate Windows registry key to try if the first key is not
found.  The alternate key uses the same \fBregname\fP and \fBregappend\fP

Setting used to control when to paginate and with what external tool. See
\%\fBhg help pager\fP\: for details.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBpager\fP
.sp
Define the external tool used as pager.
.sp
If no pager is set, Mercurial uses the environment variable $PAGER.
If neither pager.pager, nor $PAGER is set, a default pager will be
used, typically \fIless\fP on Unix and \fImore\fP on Windows. Example:
.sp

.sp
Settings used when applying patches, for instance through the \(aqimport\(aq
command or with Mercurial Queues extension.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBeol\fP
.sp
When set to \(aqstrict\(aq patch content and patched files end of lines
are preserved. When set to \fBlf\fP or \fBcrlf\fP, both files end of
lines are ignored when patching and the result line endings are
normalized to either LF (Unix) or CRLF (Windows). When set to
\fBauto\fP, end of lines are again ignored while patching but line
endings in patched files are normalized to their original setting
on a per\-file basis. If target file does not exist or has no end
of line, patch line endings are preserved.
(default: strict)
.TP
.B \fBfuzz\fP
.sp
The number of lines of \(aqfuzz\(aq to allow when applying patches. This
controls how much context the patcher is allowed to ignore when
trying to apply a patch.
(default: 2)
.UNINDENT
.SS \fBpaths\fP
.sp
Assigns symbolic names and behavior to repositories.
.sp
Options are symbolic names defining the URL or directory that is the
location of the repository. Example:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[paths]
my_server = https://example.com/my_repo
local_path = /home/me/repo
.ft P
.fi
.sp
These symbolic names can be used from the command line. To pull
from \fBmy_server\fP: \%\fBhg pull my_server\fP\:. To push to \fBlocal_path\fP:
\%\fBhg push local_path\fP\:.
.sp
Options containing colons (\fB:\fP) denote sub\-options that can influence
behavior for that specific path. Example:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[paths]
my_server = https://example.com/my_path
my_server:pushurl = ssh://example.com/my_path
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The following sub\-options can be defined:
.INDENT 0.0

The URL to use for push operations. If not defined, the location
defined by the path\(aqs main entry is used.
.TP
.B \fBpushrev\fP
.sp
A revset defining which revisions to push by default.
.sp
When \%\fBhg push\fP\: is executed without a \fB\-r\fP argument, the revset
defined by this sub\-option is evaluated to determine what to push.
.sp
For example, a value of \fB.\fP will push the working directory\(aqs
revision by default.
.sp
Revsets specifying bookmarks will not result in the bookmark being
pushed.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The following special named paths exist:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBdefault\fP
.sp
The URL or directory to use when no source or remote is specified.
.sp
\%\fBhg clone\fP\: will automatically define this path to the location the
repository was cloned from.
.TP
.B \fBdefault\-push\fP
.sp
(deprecated) The URL or directory for the default \%\fBhg push\fP\: location.
\fBdefault:pushurl\fP should be used instead.
.UNINDENT
.SS \fBphases\fP
.sp
Specifies default handling of phases. See \%\fBhg help phases\fP\: for more
information about working with phases.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBpublish\fP
.sp
Controls draft phase behavior when working as a server. When true,
pushed changesets are set to public in both client and server and
pulled or cloned changesets are set to public in the client.
(default: True)
.TP
.B \fBnew\-commit\fP
.sp
Phase of newly\-created commits.
(default: draft)
.TP
.B \fBchecksubrepos\fP
.sp
Check the phase of the current revision of each subrepository. Allowed
values are "ignore", "follow" and "abort". For settings other than
"ignore", the phase of the current revision of each subrepository is
checked before committing the parent repository. If any of those phases is
greater than the phase of the parent repository (e.g. if a subrepo is in a
"secret" phase while the parent repo is in "draft" phase), the commit is
either aborted (if checksubrepos is set to "abort") or the higher phase is
used for the parent repository commit (if set to "follow").
(default: follow)
.UNINDENT
.SS \fBprofiling\fP
.sp
Specifies profiling type, format, and file output. Two profilers are
supported: an instrumenting profiler (named \fBls\fP), and a sampling
profiler (named \fBstat\fP).
.sp
In this section description, \(aqprofiling data\(aq stands for the raw data
collected during profiling, while \(aqprofiling report\(aq stands for a
statistical text report generated from the profiling data. The
profiling is done using lsprof.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBenabled\fP
.sp
Enable the profiler.
(default: false)
.sp
This is equivalent to passing \fB\-\-profile\fP on the command line.
.TP

.sp
The type of profiler to use.
(default: stat)
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBls\fP
.sp
Use Python\(aqs built\-in instrumenting profiler. This profiler
works on all platforms, but each line number it reports is the
first line of a function. This restriction makes it difficult to
identify the expensive parts of a non\-trivial function.
.TP
.B \fBstat\fP
.sp
Use a statistical profiler, statprof. This profiler is most
useful for profiling commands that run for longer than about 0.1
seconds.

.sp
File path where profiling data or report should be saved. If the
file exists, it is replaced. (default: None, data is printed on
stderr)
.TP
.B \fBsort\fP
.sp
Sort field.  Specific to the \fBls\fP instrumenting profiler.
One of \fBcallcount\fP, \fBreccallcount\fP, \fBtotaltime\fP and
\fBinlinetime\fP.
(default: inlinetime)
.TP
.B \fBlimit\fP
.sp
Number of lines to show. Specific to the \fBls\fP instrumenting profiler.
(default: 30)
.TP
.B \fBnested\fP
.sp
Show at most this number of lines of drill\-down info after each main entry.
This can help explain the difference between Total and Inline.
Specific to the \fBls\fP instrumenting profiler.
(default: 5)
.TP
.B \fBshowmin\fP
.sp
Minimum fraction of samples an entry must have for it to be displayed.
Can be specified as a float between \fB0.0\fP and \fB1.0\fP or can have a
\fB%\fP afterwards to allow values up to \fB100\fP. e.g. \fB5%\fP.
.sp
Only used by the \fBstat\fP profiler.
.sp
For the \fBhotpath\fP format, default is \fB0.05\fP.
For the \fBchrome\fP format, default is \fB0.005\fP.
.sp
The option is unused on other formats.
.TP
.B \fBshowmax\fP
.sp
Maximum fraction of samples an entry can have before it is ignored in
display. Values format is the same as \fBshowmin\fP.
.sp
Only used by the \fBstat\fP profiler.
.sp
For the \fBchrome\fP format, default is \fB0.999\fP.
.sp
The option is unused on other formats.
.UNINDENT
.SS \fBprogress\fP
.sp
Mercurial commands can draw progress bars that are as informative as
possible. Some progress bars only offer indeterminate information, while others
have a definite end point.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBdelay\fP
.sp
Number of seconds (float) before showing the progress bar. (default: 3)
.TP
.B \fBchangedelay\fP
.sp
Minimum delay before showing a new topic. When set to less than 3 * refresh,
that value will be used instead. (default: 1)
.TP
.B \fBrefresh\fP

.TP
.B \fBformat\fP
.sp
Format of the progress bar.
.sp
Valid entries for the format field are \fBtopic\fP, \fBbar\fP, \fBnumber\fP,
\fBunit\fP, \fBestimate\fP, \fBspeed\fP, and \fBitem\fP. \fBitem\fP defaults to the
last 20 characters of the item, but this can be changed by adding either
\fB\-<num>\fP which would take the last num characters, or \fB+<num>\fP for the
first num characters.
.sp
(default: topic bar number estimate)
.TP
.B \fBwidth\fP
.sp
If set, the maximum width of the progress information (that is, min(width,
term width) will be used).
.TP
.B \fBclear\-complete\fP

Alias definitions for revsets. See \%\fBhg help revsets\fP\: for details.
.SS \fBserver\fP
.sp
Controls generic server settings.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBcompressionengines\fP
.sp
List of compression engines and their relative priority to advertise
to clients.
.sp
The order of compression engines determines their priority, the first
having the highest priority. If a compression engine is not listed
here, it won\(aqt be advertised to clients.
.sp
If not set (the default), built\-in defaults are used. Run
\%\fBhg debuginstall\fP\: to list available compression engines and their
default wire protocol priority.
.sp
Older Mercurial clients only support zlib compression and this setting
has no effect for legacy clients.
.TP
.B \fBuncompressed\fP
.sp
Whether to allow clients to clone a repository using the
uncompressed streaming protocol. This transfers about 40% more
data than a regular clone, but uses less memory and CPU on both
server and client. Over a LAN (100 Mbps or better) or a very fast
WAN, an uncompressed streaming clone is a lot faster (~10x) than a
regular clone. Over most WAN connections (anything slower than
about 6 Mbps), uncompressed streaming is slower, because of the
extra data transfer overhead. This mode will also temporarily hold
the write lock while determining what data to transfer.
(default: True)
.TP
.B \fBuncompressedallowsecret\fP
.sp
Whether to allow stream clones when the repository contains secret
changesets. (default: False)
.TP
.B \fBpreferuncompressed\fP
.sp
When set, clients will try to use the uncompressed streaming
protocol. (default: False)
.TP
.B \fBdisablefullbundle\fP
.sp
When set, servers will refuse attempts to do pull\-based clones.
If this option is set, \fBpreferuncompressed\fP and/or clone bundles
are highly recommended. Partial clones will still be allowed.
(default: False)
.TP
.B \fBconcurrent\-push\-mode\fP
.sp
Level of allowed race condition between two pushing clients.
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
\(aqstrict\(aq: push is abort if another client touched the repository
while the push was preparing. (default)
.IP \(bu 2
.
\(aqcheck\-related\(aq: push is only aborted if it affects head that got also
affected while the push was preparing.
.UNINDENT
.sp
This requires compatible client (version 4.3 and later). Old client will
use \(aqstrict\(aq.
.TP
.B \fBvalidate\fP
.sp
Whether to validate the completeness of pushed changesets by
checking that all new file revisions specified in manifests are
present. (default: False)
.TP
.B \fBmaxhttpheaderlen\fP
.sp
Instruct HTTP clients not to send request headers longer than this
many bytes. (default: 1024)
.TP
.B \fBbundle1\fP
.sp
Whether to allow clients to push and pull using the legacy bundle1
exchange format. (default: True)
.TP
.B \fBbundle1gd\fP
.sp
Like \fBbundle1\fP but only used if the repository is using the
\fIgeneraldelta\fP storage format. (default: True)
.TP
.B \fBbundle1.push\fP
.sp
Whether to allow clients to push using the legacy bundle1 exchange
format. (default: True)
.TP
.B \fBbundle1gd.push\fP
.sp
Like \fBbundle1.push\fP but only used if the repository is using the
\fIgeneraldelta\fP storage format. (default: True)
.TP
.B \fBbundle1.pull\fP
.sp
Whether to allow clients to pull using the legacy bundle1 exchange
format. (default: True)
.TP
.B \fBbundle1gd.pull\fP
.sp
Like \fBbundle1.pull\fP but only used if the repository is using the
\fIgeneraldelta\fP storage format. (default: True)
.sp
Large repositories using the \fIgeneraldelta\fP storage format should
consider setting this option because converting \fIgeneraldelta\fP
repositories to the exchange format required by the bundle1 data
format can consume a lot of CPU.
.TP
.B \fBzliblevel\fP
.sp
Integer between \fB\-1\fP and \fB9\fP that controls the zlib compression level
for wire protocol commands that send zlib compressed output (notably the
commands that send repository history data).
.sp
The default (\fB\-1\fP) uses the default zlib compression level, which is
likely equivalent to \fB6\fP. \fB0\fP means no compression. \fB9\fP means
maximum compression.
.sp
Setting this option allows server operators to make trade\-offs between
bandwidth and CPU used. Lowering the compression lowers CPU utilization
but sends more bytes to clients.
.sp
This option only impacts the HTTP server.
.TP
.B \fBzstdlevel\fP
.sp
Integer between \fB1\fP and \fB22\fP that controls the zstd compression level
for wire protocol commands. \fB1\fP is the minimal amount of compression and
\fB22\fP is the highest amount of compression.
.sp
The default (\fB3\fP) should be significantly faster than zlib while likely
delivering better compression ratios.
.sp
This option only impacts the HTTP server.
.sp
See also \fBserver.zliblevel\fP.
.UNINDENT
.SS \fBsmtp\fP
.sp
Configuration for extensions that need to send email messages.

Optional. Port to connect to on mail server. (default: 465 if
\fBtls\fP is smtps; 25 otherwise)
.TP
.B \fBtls\fP
.sp
Optional. Method to enable TLS when connecting to mail server: starttls,
smtps or none. (default: none)
.TP
.B \fBusername\fP
.sp
Optional. User name for authenticating with the SMTP server.
(default: None)
.TP
.B \fBpassword\fP
.sp
Optional. Password for authenticating with the SMTP server. If not
specified, interactive sessions will prompt the user for a
password; non\-interactive sessions will fail. (default: None)
.TP
.B \fBlocal_hostname\fP
.sp
Optional. The hostname that the sender can use to identify
itself to the MTA.
.UNINDENT
.SS \fBsubpaths\fP
.sp
Subrepository source URLs can go stale if a remote server changes name
or becomes temporarily unavailable. This section lets you define
rewrite rules of the form:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
<pattern> = <replacement>
.ft P
.fi
.sp
where \fBpattern\fP is a regular expression matching a subrepository
source URL and \fBreplacement\fP is the replacement string used to
rewrite it. Groups can be matched in \fBpattern\fP and referenced in
\fBreplacements\fP. For instance:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
http://server/(.*)\-hg/ = http://hg.server/\e1/
.ft P
.fi
.sp
rewrites \fBhttp://server/foo\-hg/\fP into \fBhttp://hg.server/foo/\fP.
.sp
Relative subrepository paths are first made absolute, and the
rewrite rules are then applied on the full (absolute) path. If \fBpattern\fP
doesn\(aqt match the full path, an attempt is made to apply it on the
relative path alone. The rules are applied in definition order.
.SS \fBtemplatealias\fP
.sp
Alias definitions for templates. See \%\fBhg help templates\fP\: for details.
.SS \fBtemplates\fP
.sp
Use the \fB[templates]\fP section to define template strings.
See \%\fBhg help templates\fP\: for details.
.SS \fBtrusted\fP
.sp
Mercurial will not use the settings in the
\fB.hg/hgrc\fP file from a repository if it doesn\(aqt belong to a trusted
user or to a trusted group, as various hgrc features allow arbitrary
commands to be run. This issue is often encountered when configuring
hooks or extensions for shared repositories or servers. However,
the web interface will use some safe settings from the \fB[web]\fP
section.
.sp
This section specifies what users and groups are trusted. The
current user is always trusted. To trust everybody, list a user or a
group with name \fB*\fP. These settings must be placed in an
\fIalready\-trusted file\fP to take effect, such as \fB$HOME/.hgrc\fP of the
user or service running Mercurial.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBusers\fP
.sp
Comma\-separated list of trusted users.
.TP
.B \fBgroups\fP
.sp
Comma\-separated list of trusted groups.
.UNINDENT
.SS \fBui\fP
.sp
User interface controls.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBarchivemeta\fP
.sp
Whether to include the .hg_archival.txt file containing meta data
(hashes for the repository base and for tip) in archives created
by the \%\fBhg archive\fP\: command or downloaded via hgweb.
(default: True)
.TP
.B \fBaskusername\fP
.sp
Whether to prompt for a username when committing. If True, and
neither \fB$HGUSER\fP nor \fB$EMAIL\fP has been specified, then the user will
be prompted to enter a username. If no username is entered, the
default \fBUSER@HOST\fP is used instead.
(default: False)
.TP
.B \fBclonebundles\fP
.sp
Whether the "clone bundles" feature is enabled.
.sp
When enabled, \%\fBhg clone\fP\: may download and apply a server\-advertised
bundle file from a URL instead of using the normal exchange mechanism.
.sp
This can likely result in faster and more reliable clones.
.sp
(default: True)
.TP
.B \fBclonebundlefallback\fP
.sp
Whether failure to apply an advertised "clone bundle" from a server
should result in fallback to a regular clone.
.sp
This is disabled by default because servers advertising "clone
bundles" often do so to reduce server load. If advertised bundles
start mass failing and clients automatically fall back to a regular
clone, this would add significant and unexpected load to the server
since the server is expecting clone operations to be offloaded to
pre\-generated bundles. Failing fast (the default behavior) ensures
clients don\(aqt overwhelm the server when "clone bundle" application
fails.
.sp
(default: False)
.TP
.B \fBclonebundleprefers\fP
.sp
Defines preferences for which "clone bundles" to use.
.sp
Servers advertising "clone bundles" may advertise multiple available
bundles. Each bundle may have different attributes, such as the bundle
type and compression format. This option is used to prefer a particular
bundle over another.
.sp
The following keys are defined by Mercurial:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B BUNDLESPEC
.
A bundle type specifier. These are strings passed to \%\fBhg bundle \-t\fP\:.
e.g. \fBgzip\-v2\fP or \fBbzip2\-v1\fP.
.TP
.B COMPRESSION
.
The compression format of the bundle. e.g. \fBgzip\fP and \fBbzip2\fP.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Server operators may define custom keys.
.sp
Example values: \fBCOMPRESSION=bzip2\fP,
\fBBUNDLESPEC=gzip\-v2, COMPRESSION=gzip\fP.
.sp
By default, the first bundle advertised by the server is used.
.TP
.B \fBcolor\fP
.sp
When to colorize output. Possible value are Boolean ("yes" or "no"), or
"debug", or "always". (default: "yes"). "yes" will use color whenever it
seems possible. See \%\fBhg help color\fP\: for details.
.TP
.B \fBcommitsubrepos\fP
.sp
Whether to commit modified subrepositories when committing the
parent repository. If False and one subrepository has uncommitted
changes, abort the commit.
(default: False)
.TP
.B \fBdebug\fP
.sp
Print debugging information. (default: False)
.TP
.B \fBeditor\fP
.sp
The editor to use during a commit. (default: \fB$EDITOR\fP or \fBvi\fP)
.TP
.B \fBfallbackencoding\fP
.sp
Encoding to try if it\(aqs not possible to decode the changelog using
UTF\-8. (default: ISO\-8859\-1)
.TP
.B \fBgraphnodetemplate\fP
.sp
The template used to print changeset nodes in an ASCII revision graph.
(default: \fB{graphnode}\fP)
.TP
.B \fBignore\fP
.sp
A file to read per\-user ignore patterns from. This file should be
in the same format as a repository\-wide .hgignore file. Filenames
are relative to the repository root. This option supports hook syntax,
so if you want to specify multiple ignore files, you can do so by
setting something like \fBignore.other = ~/.hgignore2\fP. For details
of the ignore file format, see the \fBhgignore(5)\fP man page.
.TP
.B \fBinteractive\fP
.sp
Allow to prompt the user. (default: True)
.TP
.B \fBinterface\fP
.sp
Select the default interface for interactive features (default: text).
Possible values are \(aqtext\(aq and \(aqcurses\(aq.
.TP
.B \fBinterface.chunkselector\fP
.sp
Select the interface for change recording (e.g. \%\fBhg commit \-i\fP\:).
Possible values are \(aqtext\(aq and \(aqcurses\(aq.
This config overrides the interface specified by ui.interface.
.TP
.B \fBlogtemplate\fP
.sp
Template string for commands that print changesets.
.TP
.B \fBmerge\fP
.sp
The conflict resolution program to use during a manual merge.
For more information on merge tools see \%\fBhg help merge\-tools\fP\:.
For configuring merge tools see the \fB[merge\-tools]\fP section.
.TP
.B \fBmergemarkers\fP
.sp
Sets the merge conflict marker label styling. The \fBdetailed\fP
style uses the \fBmergemarkertemplate\fP setting to style the labels.
The \fBbasic\fP style just uses \(aqlocal\(aq and \(aqother\(aq as the marker label.
One of \fBbasic\fP or \fBdetailed\fP.
(default: \fBbasic\fP)
.TP
.B \fBmergemarkertemplate\fP
.sp
The template used to print the commit description next to each conflict
marker during merge conflicts. See \%\fBhg help templates\fP\: for the template
format.
.sp
Defaults to showing the hash, tags, branches, bookmarks, author, and
the first line of the commit description.
.sp
If you use non\-ASCII characters in names for tags, branches, bookmarks,
authors, and/or commit descriptions, you must pay attention to encodings of
managed files. At template expansion, non\-ASCII characters use the encoding
specified by the \fB\-\-encoding\fP global option, \fBHGENCODING\fP or other
environment variables that govern your locale. If the encoding of the merge
markers is different from the encoding of the merged files,
serious problems may occur.
.TP
.B \fBorigbackuppath\fP
.sp
The path to a directory used to store generated .orig files. If the path is
not a directory, one will be created.
.TP
.B \fBpaginate\fP
.sp
Control the pagination of command output (default: True). See \%\fBhg help pager\fP\:
for details.
.TP
.B \fBpatch\fP
.sp
An optional external tool that \fBhg import\fP and some extensions
will use for applying patches. By default Mercurial uses an
internal patch utility. The external tool must work as the common
Unix \fBpatch\fP program. In particular, it must accept a \fB\-p\fP
argument to strip patch headers, a \fB\-d\fP argument to specify the
current directory, a file name to patch, and a patch file to take
from stdin.
.sp
It is possible to specify a patch tool together with extra
arguments. For example, setting this option to \fBpatch \-\-merge\fP
will use the \fBpatch\fP program with its 2\-way merge option.
.TP
.B \fBportablefilenames\fP
.sp
Check for portable filenames. Can be \fBwarn\fP, \fBignore\fP or \fBabort\fP.
(default: \fBwarn\fP)
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBwarn\fP
.sp
Print a warning message on POSIX platforms, if a file with a non\-portable
filename is added (e.g. a file with a name that can\(aqt be created on
Windows because it contains reserved parts like \fBAUX\fP, reserved
characters like \fB:\fP, or would cause a case collision with an existing
file).
.TP
.B \fBignore\fP
.sp
Don\(aqt print a warning.
.TP
.B \fBabort\fP
.sp
The command is aborted.
.TP
.B \fBtrue\fP
.sp
Alias for \fBwarn\fP.
.TP
.B \fBfalse\fP
.sp
Alias for \fBignore\fP.
.UNINDENT
.sp
On Windows, this configuration option is ignored and the command aborted.
.TP
.B \fBquiet\fP
.sp
Reduce the amount of output printed.
(default: False)
.TP
.B \fBremotecmd\fP
.sp
Remote command to use for clone/push/pull operations.
(default: \fBhg\fP)
.TP
.B \fBreport_untrusted\fP
.sp
Warn if a \fB.hg/hgrc\fP file is ignored due to not being owned by a
trusted user or group.
(default: True)
.TP
.B \fBslash\fP
.sp
Display paths using a slash (\fB/\fP) as the path separator. This
only makes a difference on systems where the default path
separator is not the slash character (e.g. Windows uses the
backslash character (\fB\e\fP)).
(default: False)
.TP
.B \fBstatuscopies\fP
.sp
Display copies in the status command.
.TP
.B \fBssh\fP
.sp
Command to use for SSH connections. (default: \fBssh\fP)
.TP
.B \fBstrict\fP
.sp
Require exact command names, instead of allowing unambiguous
abbreviations. (default: False)
.TP
.B \fBstyle\fP
.sp
Name of style to use for command output.
.TP
.B \fBsupportcontact\fP
.sp
A URL where users should report a Mercurial traceback. Use this if you are a
large organisation with its own Mercurial deployment process and crash
reports should be addressed to your internal support.
.TP
.B \fBtextwidth\fP
.sp
Maximum width of help text. A longer line generated by \fBhg help\fP or
\fBhg subcommand \-\-help\fP will be broken after white space to get this
width or the terminal width, whichever comes first.
A non\-positive value will disable this and the terminal width will be
used. (default: 78)
.TP
.B \fBtimeout\fP
.sp
The timeout used when a lock is held (in seconds), a negative value
means no timeout. (default: 600)
.TP
.B \fBtraceback\fP
.sp
Mercurial always prints a traceback when an unknown exception
occurs. Setting this to True will make Mercurial print a traceback
on all exceptions, even those recognized by Mercurial (such as
IOError or MemoryError). (default: False)
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBtweakdefaults\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
By default Mercurial\(aqs behavior changes very little from release
to release, but over time the recommended config settings
shift. Enable this config to opt in to get automatic tweaks to
Mercurial\(aqs behavior over time. This config setting will have no
effet if \fBHGPLAIN\(ga is set or \(ga\(gaHGPLAINEXCEPT\fP is set and does
not include \fBtweakdefaults\fP. (default: False)
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBusername\fP
.sp
The committer of a changeset created when running "commit".
Typically a person\(aqs name and email address, e.g. \fBFred Widget
<fred@example.com>\fP. Environment variables in the
username are expanded.
.sp
(default: \fB$EMAIL\fP or \fBusername@hostname\fP. If the username in
hgrc is empty, e.g. if the system admin set \fBusername =\fP in the
system hgrc, it has to be specified manually or in a different
hgrc file)
.TP
.B \fBverbose\fP
.sp
Increase the amount of output printed. (default: False)
.UNINDENT
.SS \fBweb\fP
.sp
Web interface configuration. The settings in this section apply to
both the builtin webserver (started by \%\fBhg serve\fP\:) and the script you
run through a webserver (\fBhgweb.cgi\fP and the derivatives for FastCGI
and WSGI).
.sp
The Mercurial webserver does no authentication (it does not prompt for
usernames and passwords to validate \fIwho\fP users are), but it does do
authorization (it grants or denies access for \fIauthenticated users\fP
based on settings in this section). You must either configure your
webserver to do authentication for you, or disable the authorization
checks.
.sp
For a quick setup in a trusted environment, e.g., a private LAN, where
you want it to accept pushes from anybody, you can use the following
command line:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ hg \-\-config web.allow_push=* \-\-config web.push_ssl=False serve
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Note that this will allow anybody to push anything to the server and
that this should not be used for public servers.
.sp
The full set of options is:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBaccesslog\fP
.sp
Where to output the access log. (default: stdout)
.TP
.B \fBaddress\fP
.sp
Interface address to bind to. (default: all)
.TP
.B \fBallow_archive\fP
.sp
List of archive format (bz2, gz, zip) allowed for downloading.
(default: empty)
.TP
.B \fBallowbz2\fP
.sp
(DEPRECATED) Whether to allow .tar.bz2 downloading of repository
revisions.
(default: False)
.TP
.B \fBallowgz\fP
.sp
(DEPRECATED) Whether to allow .tar.gz downloading of repository
revisions.
(default: False)
.TP
.B \fBallowpull\fP
.sp
Whether to allow pulling from the repository. (default: True)
.TP
.B \fBallow_push\fP
.sp
Whether to allow pushing to the repository. If empty or not set,
pushing is not allowed. If the special value \fB*\fP, any remote
user can push, including unauthenticated users. Otherwise, the
remote user must have been authenticated, and the authenticated
user name must be present in this list. The contents of the
allow_push list are examined after the deny_push list.
.TP
.B \fBallow_read\fP
.sp
If the user has not already been denied repository access due to
the contents of deny_read, this list determines whether to grant
repository access to the user. If this list is not empty, and the
user is unauthenticated or not present in the list, then access is
denied for the user. If the list is empty or not set, then access
is permitted to all users by default. Setting allow_read to the
special value \fB*\fP is equivalent to it not being set (i.e. access
is permitted to all users). The contents of the allow_read list are
examined after the deny_read list.
.TP
.B \fBallowzip\fP
.sp
(DEPRECATED) Whether to allow .zip downloading of repository
revisions. This feature creates temporary files.
(default: False)
.TP
.B \fBarchivesubrepos\fP
.sp
Whether to recurse into subrepositories when archiving.
(default: False)
.TP
.B \fBbaseurl\fP
.sp
Base URL to use when publishing URLs in other locations, so
third\-party tools like email notification hooks can construct
URLs. Example: \fBhttp://hgserver/repos/\fP.
.TP
.B \fBcacerts\fP
.sp
Path to file containing a list of PEM encoded certificate
authority certificates. Environment variables and \fB~user\fP
constructs are expanded in the filename. If specified on the
client, then it will verify the identity of remote HTTPS servers
with these certificates.
.sp
To disable SSL verification temporarily, specify \fB\-\-insecure\fP from
command line.
.sp
You can use OpenSSL\(aqs CA certificate file if your platform has
one. On most Linux systems this will be
\fB/etc/ssl/certs/ca\-certificates.crt\fP. Otherwise you will have to
generate this file manually. The form must be as follows:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\-\-\-\-\-BEGIN CERTIFICATE\-\-\-\-\-
\&... (certificate in base64 PEM encoding) ...
\-\-\-\-\-END CERTIFICATE\-\-\-\-\-
\-\-\-\-\-BEGIN CERTIFICATE\-\-\-\-\-
\&... (certificate in base64 PEM encoding) ...
\-\-\-\-\-END CERTIFICATE\-\-\-\-\-
.ft P
.fi
.TP
.B \fBcache\fP
.sp
Whether to support caching in hgweb. (default: True)
.TP
.B \fBcertificate\fP
.sp
Certificate to use when running \%\fBhg serve\fP\:.
.TP
.B \fBcollapse\fP
.sp
With \fBdescend\fP enabled, repositories in subdirectories are shown at
a single level alongside repositories in the current path. With
\fBcollapse\fP also enabled, repositories residing at a deeper level than
the current path are grouped behind navigable directory entries that
lead to the locations of these repositories. In effect, this setting
collapses each collection of repositories found within a subdirectory
into a single entry for that subdirectory. (default: False)
.TP
.B \fBcomparisoncontext\fP
.sp
Number of lines of context to show in side\-by\-side file comparison. If
negative or the value \fBfull\fP, whole files are shown. (default: 5)
.sp
This setting can be overridden by a \fBcontext\fP request parameter to the
\fBcomparison\fP command, taking the same values.
.TP
.B \fBcontact\fP
.sp
Name or email address of the person in charge of the repository.
(default: ui.username or \fB$EMAIL\fP or "unknown" if unset or empty)
.TP
.B \fBcsp\fP
.sp
Send a \fBContent\-Security\-Policy\fP HTTP header with this value.
.sp
The value may contain a special string \fB%nonce%\fP, which will be replaced
by a randomly\-generated one\-time use value. If the value contains
\fB%nonce%\fP, \fBweb.cache\fP will be disabled, as caching undermines the
one\-time property of the nonce. This nonce will also be inserted into
\fB<script>\fP elements containing inline JavaScript.
.sp
Note: lots of HTML content sent by the server is derived from repository
data. Please consider the potential for malicious repository data to
"inject" itself into generated HTML content as part of your security
threat model.
.TP
.B \fBdeny_push\fP
.sp
Whether to deny pushing to the repository. If empty or not set,
push is not denied. If the special value \fB*\fP, all remote users are
denied push. Otherwise, unauthenticated users are all denied, and
any authenticated user name present in this list is also denied. The
contents of the deny_push list are examined before the allow_push list.
.TP
.B \fBdeny_read\fP
.sp
Whether to deny reading/viewing of the repository. If this list is
not empty, unauthenticated users are all denied, and any
authenticated user name present in this list is also denied access to
the repository. If set to the special value \fB*\fP, all remote users
are denied access (rarely needed ;). If deny_read is empty or not set,
the determination of repository access depends on the presence and
content of the allow_read list (see description). If both
deny_read and allow_read are empty or not set, then access is
permitted to all users by default. If the repository is being
served via hgwebdir, denied users will not be able to see it in
the list of repositories. The contents of the deny_read list have
priority over (are examined before) the contents of the allow_read
list.
.TP
.B \fBdescend\fP
.sp
hgwebdir indexes will not descend into subdirectories. Only repositories
directly in the current path will be shown (other repositories are still
available from the index corresponding to their containing path).
.TP
.B \fBdescription\fP
.sp
Textual description of the repository\(aqs purpose or contents.
(default: "unknown")
.TP
.B \fBencoding\fP
.sp
Character encoding name. (default: the current locale charset)
Example: "UTF\-8".
.TP
.B \fBerrorlog\fP
.sp
Where to output the error log. (default: stderr)
.TP
.B \fBguessmime\fP
.sp
Control MIME types for raw download of file content.
Set to True to let hgweb guess the content type from the file
extension. This will serve HTML files as \fBtext/html\fP and might
allow cross\-site scripting attacks when serving untrusted
repositories. (default: False)
.TP
.B \fBhidden\fP
.sp
Whether to hide the repository in the hgwebdir index.
(default: False)
.TP
.B \fBipv6\fP
.sp
Whether to use IPv6. (default: False)
.TP
.B \fBlabels\fP
.sp
List of string \fIlabels\fP associated with the repository.
.sp
Labels are exposed as a template keyword and can be used to customize
output. e.g. the \fBindex\fP template can group or filter repositories
by labels and the \fBsummary\fP template can display additional content
if a specific label is present.
.TP
.B \fBlogoimg\fP
.sp
File name of the logo image that some templates display on each page.
The file name is relative to \fBstaticurl\fP. That is, the full path to
the logo image is "staticurl/logoimg".
If unset, \fBhglogo.png\fP will be used.
.TP
.B \fBlogourl\fP
.sp
Base URL to use for logos. If unset, \fBhttps://mercurial\-scm.org/\fP
will be used.
.TP
.B \fBmaxchanges\fP
.sp
Maximum number of changes to list on the changelog. (default: 10)
.TP
.B \fBmaxfiles\fP
.sp
Maximum number of files to list per changeset. (default: 10)
.TP
.B \fBmaxshortchanges\fP
.sp
Maximum number of changes to list on the shortlog, graph or filelog
pages. (default: 60)
.TP
.B \fBname\fP
.sp
Repository name to use in the web interface.
(default: current working directory)
.TP
.B \fBport\fP
.sp
Port to listen on. (default: 8000)
.TP
.B \fBprefix\fP
.sp
Prefix path to serve from. (default: \(aq\(aq (server root))
.TP
.B \fBpush_ssl\fP
.sp
Whether to require that inbound pushes be transported over SSL to
prevent password sniffing. (default: True)
.TP
.B \fBrefreshinterval\fP
.sp
How frequently directory listings re\-scan the filesystem for new
repositories, in seconds. This is relevant when wildcards are used
to define paths. Depending on how much filesystem traversal is
required, refreshing may negatively impact performance.
.sp
Values less than or equal to 0 always refresh.
(default: 20)
.TP
.B \fBstaticurl\fP
.sp
Base URL to use for static files. If unset, static files (e.g. the
hgicon.png favicon) will be served by the CGI script itself. Use
this setting to serve them directly with the HTTP server.
Example: \fBhttp://hgserver/static/\fP.
.TP
.B \fBstripes\fP
.sp
How many lines a "zebra stripe" should span in multi\-line output.
Set to 0 to disable. (default: 1)
.TP
.B \fBstyle\fP
.sp
Which template map style to use. The available options are the names of
subdirectories in the HTML templates path. (default: \fBpaper\fP)
Example: \fBmonoblue\fP.
.TP
.B \fBtemplates\fP
.sp
Where to find the HTML templates. The default path to the HTML templates
can be obtained from \fBhg debuginstall\fP.
.UNINDENT
.SS \fBwebsub\fP
.sp
Web substitution filter definition. You can use this section to
define a set of regular expression substitution patterns which
let you automatically modify the hgweb server output.
.sp
The default hgweb templates only apply these substitution patterns
on the revision description fields. You can apply them anywhere
you want when you create your own templates by adding calls to the
"websub" filter (usually after calling the "escape" filter).
.sp
This can be used, for example, to convert issue references to links
to your issue tracker, or to convert "markdown\-like" syntax into
HTML (see the examples below).
.sp
Each entry in this section names a substitution filter.
The value of each entry defines the substitution expression itself.
The websub expressions follow the old interhg extension syntax,
which in turn imitates the Unix sed replacement syntax:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
patternname = s/SEARCH_REGEX/REPLACE_EXPRESSION/[i]
.ft P
.fi
.sp
You can use any separator other than "/". The final "i" is optional
and indicates that the search must be case insensitive.
.sp
Examples:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[websub]
issues = s|issue(\ed+)|<a href="http://bts.example.org/issue\e1">issue\e1</a>|i
italic = s/\eb_(\eS+)_\eb/<i>\e1<\e/i>/
bold = s/\e*\eb(\eS+)\eb\e*/<b>\e1<\e/b>/
.ft P
.fi
.SS \fBworker\fP
.sp
Parallel master/worker configuration. We currently perform working
directory updates in parallel on Unix\-like systems, which greatly
helps performance.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBnumcpus\fP
.sp
Number of CPUs to use for parallel operations. A zero or
negative value is treated as \fBuse the default\fP.
(default: 4 or the number of CPUs on the system, whichever is larger)
.TP
.B \fBbackgroundclose\fP
.sp
Whether to enable closing file handles on background threads during certain
operations. Some platforms aren\(aqt very efficient at closing file
handles that have been written or appended to. By performing file closing
on background threads, file write rate can increase substantially.
(default: true on Windows, false elsewhere)
.TP
.B \fBbackgroundcloseminfilecount\fP
.sp
Minimum number of files required to trigger background file closing.
Operations not writing this many files won\(aqt start background close
threads.
(default: 2048)
.TP
.B \fBbackgroundclosemaxqueue\fP
.sp
The maximum number of opened file handles waiting to be closed in the
background. This option only has an effect if \fBbackgroundclose\fP is
enabled.
(default: 384)
.TP
.B \fBbackgroundclosethreadcount\fP
.sp
Number of threads to process background file closes. Only relevant if
\fBbackgroundclose\fP is enabled.
(default: 4)
