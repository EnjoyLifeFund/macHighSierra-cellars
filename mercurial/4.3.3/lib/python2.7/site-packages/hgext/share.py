'''share a common history between several working directories

Automatic Pooled Storage for Clones
-----------------------------------

When this extension is active, :hg:`clone` can be configured to
automatically share/pool storage across multiple clones. This
mode effectively converts :hg:`clone` to :hg:`clone` + :hg:`share`.
The benefit of using this mode is the automatic management of
store paths and intelligent pooling of related repositories.

The following ``share.`` config options influence this feature:

``share.pool``
    Filesystem path where shared repository data will be stored. When
    defined, :hg:`clone` will automatically use shared repository
    storage instead of creating a store inside each clone.

``share.poolnaming``
    How directory names in ``share.pool`` are constructed.

    "identity" means the name is derived from the first changeset in the
    repository. In this mode, different remotes share storage if their
    root/initial changeset is identical. In this mode, the local shared
    repository is an aggregate of all encountered remote repositories.

    "remote" means the name is derived from the source repository's
    path or URL. In this mode, storage is only shared if the path or URL
    requested in the :hg:`clone` command matches exactly to a repository
    that was cloned before.

    The default naming mode is "identity."

       using rollback or extensions that destroy/modify history (mq,
