.TH DSPNT2S 3NCARG "September 1997-1998" UNIX "NCAR GRAPHICS"
.SH NAME
DSPNT2S- Interpolate at a single point (or points) in 2D in single precision
.SH SYNOPSIS
CALL DSPNT2S (N, X, Y, Z, M, XO, YO, ZO, IER)
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IP N 12
(Integer, Input) - The number of input data points. 
.IP X 12
(Real, Input) - An array containing the X coordinates of the 
input data points. 
.IP Y 12
(Real, Input) - An array containing the Y coordinates of the 
input data points.
.IP Z 12
(Real, Input) - An array containing the functional values of the 
input data points. That is, Z(L) is the value of the input
function at coordinate (X(L),Y(L)), for L=1,N. 
.IP M 12
(Integer, Input) - The number of output data points (this may be "1"). 
.IP XO 12
(Real, Input) - An array of dimension M containing the X coordinates 
of the output data. The values in XO may be in any order.
.IP YO 12
(Real, Input) - An array of dimension M containing the Y coordinates 
of the output data. The values in YO may be in any order. 
.IP ZO 12
(Real, Output) - An array of dimension M containing the interpolated 
values. ZO(I) is the interpolated value at point (XO(I),YO(I)) for I=1,M. 
.IP IER 12
(Integer, Output) - An error return value. If IER is returned as 0, then
no errors were detected. If IER is non-zero, then refer to the man
page for dsgrid_errors for details.
.SH USAGE
This subroutine is called when you want to interpolate at an individual
point or points. 
.SH ACCESS
To use DSPNT2S, load the NCAR Graphics library ngmath.
