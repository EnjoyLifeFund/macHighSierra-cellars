.SH NAME
FRSTD -
Defines the first of a sequence of points through which a curve is to be
drawn.
.SH SYNOPSIS
CALL FRSTD (X,Y)
.SH C-BINDING SYNOPSIS
#include <ncarg/ncargC.h>
.sp
void c_frstd (float x, float y)
.SH DESCRIPTION 
.IP X 12
(an input expression of type REAL) defines the X user coordinate of
the starting point of the curve.
.IP Y 12
(an input expression of type REAL) defines the Y user coordinate of
the starting point of the curve.
.SH C-BINDING DESCRIPTION
The C-binding argument descriptions are the same as the FORTRAN 
argument descriptions.
.SH USAGE
One way to draw a curve with Dashline is to call FRSTD once to define the
first point of the curve and then to call VECTD repeatedly to define the
second and all following points of the curve.
.sp
If three or more distinct points are given, and if one of
the smoothing versions of Dashline is being used, and if the internal
parameter that suppresses smoothing is not set, then splines under tension
are used to generate a smooth curve; the number of points actually used to
draw the curve will depend on its length.  In all other cases, the "curve"
will be approximated by just connecting the user-given points in the specified
order.
.sp
After the call to VECTD defining the last point of the curve, you may call
LASTD, which flushes any portions of smoothed curves that are defined by
coordinates saved in internal buffers of FRSTD and VECTD and that have not
yet been drawn.  Calls to LASTD are not always required - for example, when
a non-smoothing version of Dashline is used (no buffering) or when the next
call to an NCAR Graphics routine will be to FRSTD (which flushes the
buffers) - but unnecessary calls do no harm.  If you judge that one of the
smoothing versions of Dashline may be used, it is best to put in the calls
to LASTD.
.SH EXAMPLES
Use the ncargex command to see the following relevant examples: 
tdashc, tdashl, tdashp, tdashs,
fdldashc, fdldashd.
.SH ACCESS
To use FRSTD or c_frstd load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks,
and ncarg_c, preferably in that order.
