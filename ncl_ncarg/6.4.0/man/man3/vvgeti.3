.SH NAME
VVGETI - 
Gets the current value of a
Vectors parameter of type INTEGER.
.SH SYNOPSIS
CALL VVGETI (CNM,IVL) 
.SH C-BINDING SYNOPSIS
#include <ncarg/ncargC.h>
.sp
void c_vvgeti(char *cnm, int *ivl)
.SH DESCRIPTION 
.IP CNM 12
(CHARACTER, input) is the name of a parameter whose
integer value is to be retrieved. Only the first three
characters of CNM are examined. The three characters may
either be entirely upper or entirely lower case; mixed case
is not recognized. It is recommended that the rest of the
character string be used to improve the readability of the
code. For example, instead of just \'PLR\', use \'PLR - Polar
Input Mode\'.
.IP IVL 12
(INTEGER, output) is a variable in which the value of
the parameter specified by CNM is to be returned.
.SH C-BINDING DESCRIPTION
The C-binding argument descriptions are the same as the FORTRAN
argument descriptions.
.SH USAGE
This routine allows you to retrieve the current value of Vectors
parameters of type INTEGER.  For a complete list of parameters
available in this utility, see the vectors_params man page.
.SH ACCESS
To use VVGETI or c_vvgeti, load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks,
and ncarg_c, preferably in that order.  
.SH MESSAGES
See the vectors man page for a description of all Vectors error
messages and/or informational messages.
