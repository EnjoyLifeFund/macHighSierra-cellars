# This is essentially a Perl program.  We exec the Perl interpreter specifying
# this same file as the Perl program and use the -x option to cause the Perl
# interpreter to skip down to the Perl code.  The reason we do this instead of
# just making /usr/bin/perl the script interpreter (instead of /bin/sh) is
# that the user may have multiple Perl interpreters and the one he wants to
# use is properly located in the PATH.  The user's choice of Perl interpreter
# may be crucial, such as when the user also has a PERL5LIB environment
# variable and it selects modules that work with only a certain main
# interpreter program.
#
# An alternative some people use is to have /usr/bin/env as the script
# interpreter.  We don't do that because we think the existence and
# compatibility of /bin/sh is more reliable.
#
# Note that we aren't concerned about efficiency because the user who needs
# high efficiency can use directly the programs that this program invokes.
