ppmforge \- see http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/ppmforge.html
.SH DESCRIPTION
ppmforge is part of the Netpbm package.
Netpbm documentation is kept in HTML format.

Please refer to <http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc//ppmforge.html>.

If that doesn't work, also try <http://netpbm.sourceforge.net> and
emailing Bryan Henderson, bryanh@giraffe-data.com.

Note that it is possible to install Netpbm with the
documentation available differently.  For example, you
could simply see the documentation instead of the message
you are reading now.  The file 'doc/USERDOC' in the Netpbm
source tree contains details.
