.B Oo\&.copy o
returns a copy of object 
.B o
, that is a fresh
object with the same methods and instance variables as 
.B o
\&.

.sp

.I val id 
: 
.B < .. > -> int
.sp
Return an integer identifying this object, unique for
the current execution of the program\&. The generic comparison
and hashing functions are based on this integer\&. When an object
is obtained by unmarshaling, the id is refreshed, and thus
different from the original object\&. As a consequence, the internal
invariants of data structures such as hash table or sets containing
objects are broken after unmarshaling the data structures\&.
