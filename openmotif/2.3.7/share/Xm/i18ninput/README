i18ninput
=========

This program is set up to handle text input in any 
language. It shows the effect of changing background or
font in a text widget that uses an input method.

The main window contains a scrolled multi-line XmText, a 
one-line XmText and an XmTextField. All three have a separate
control panel for the font and background color of the text
widgets.

The key function call for enabling internationalized text
input is the call to XtSetLanguageProc in main.c. See the
man page for XtSetLanguageProc for a description of this
function. This function must be called to enable text input
through an input method.

In addition, some languages require more than one font to
render text in this language. Therefore, the demo uses
fontsets as a default.

Worth noting is that no fonts or labels are hardcoded. The
labels, colors and fonts necessary for the demo to be 
meaningful are either specified as fallback resources or
as the default value of application resources.
