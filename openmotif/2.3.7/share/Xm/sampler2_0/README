A 2.0-features oriented demo.
-----------------------------

Sampler2_0 provides a demonstration of almost all the new visible
features/widgets the OSF/Motif 2.0 release.  

It uses a Notebook as its main component and each page demonstrates
one or more different new functionalities:
	  - Container in spatial layout
	  - Container in Outline
	  - PanedWindow
	  - CDE FileSelectionBox
	  - New ToggleButton types
	  - ComboBox, Spinbox and Thermometer Scale.

XmdSampler2_0, the app-default file, is very important for usability.
Do something like:

   XENVIRONMENT=XmdSampler2_0 sampler2_0
