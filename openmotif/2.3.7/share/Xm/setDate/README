                                 SetDate
                                 -------

SetDate is a simple demonstration of the SpinBox widget.  In addition
it can be modified to make a fairly useful sysadmin tool.  One of my
long term peeves on UNIX systems is the difficultly of changing
the system clock,  SetDate can be modified to do this and setuid'ed
to make it quite easy.

Enjoy,
Doug
