                               ToDo
                               ----

ToDo is a simple list organizer.  It uses an XmNotebook widget with tabs
to help organize your lists of tasks.  It has no fancy features and
by default stores its database in the single file .todo in your home
directory.

You can use the example.todo file in this directory to see some of
the features.  Just type "./todo -todoFile example.todo" to start
this way.
