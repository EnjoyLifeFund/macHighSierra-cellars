.SH NAME
The Internationalized Extended List widget
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <Xm/Ext18List.h>
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.TS
tab (%);
l l.
.TE
.PP
This widget contains a multi-column list with headers along the top and a search area 
along the bottom. The list has scrollbars along the right and bottom edges that allow 
vertical and horizontal scrolling both by column and by pixel. The portion of the list 
data that is currently visible can be altered by scrollbar actions, widget resource setting 
and the redisplay of the list data after a string search has been successful. The sorting 
of elements within a particular column is also supported. To sort the list by the elements 
in a given column, select the column's title.
.PP
To search for a particular string in the list, type the string value to be searched for in 
the list's associated text field and then press the "Find" pushbutton. The search for the 
string begins in the currently selected row, after the location of the previously 
searched for string, or at the first column and first row if there is no column selected. 
If the string is not found in that row, then the search continues through all rows after 
and then before, the currently selected row. If the string is found, the display of the 
list is adjusted to make the string visible. If the string was not found, or if the string is 
visible, the application will issue a warning beep.
.PP
Pointer button one allows the user to select a row or a column for sorting. The callbacks 
on the doubleClickCallback list are called when the user double clicks pointer 
button one. If the list data can contain a row pixmap to display at the extreme left of 
the row.

.TE
.PP
All resource names begin with XmN and all resource class names begin with XmC.
.PP
.SH columnTitles
.PP
This is an array of length numColumns of strings displayed at the top of each 
column. The data is allocated and maintained by the client.
.PP
.SH doubleClickCallback
.PP
All routines in this list will be called whenever the user double clicks on a row in 
the list.
.PP
.SH entryData
.PP
This resource is the data associated with each row in the list. The data is an array of Xm18RowInfo structures of length numRows allocated by the client. The data is allocated and maintained by the client. The Xm18RowInfo structure is defined below.
.PP
.SH findLabel
.PP
The label to be shown on the find button. 
.PP
.SH firstColumn
.PP
This resource allows the client to adjust the current view of the list data to have a 
new top left column location. When setting this resource, firstRow should also be 
updated.
.PP
.SH firstColumnPixmaps
.PP
This resource specifies that the pixmap stored in the row info structure should be 
used instead of Xm18RowInfo values[0]. If pixmaps are present, the rows may be 
dragged by pressing on the pixmap with pointer button three. If this resource is 
True, then values[0] is never referenced. If False, then the Xm18RowInfo data 
pixmap is never referenced. 
.PP
.SH firstRow
.PP
This resource allows the client to adjust the current view of the list data to have a 
new top left row location. When setting this resource, firstColumn should also 
be updated.
.PP
.SH fontList
.PP
This is an OSF/Motif style font list. The first font in this list will be used to 
display all text in the Extended List widget. The Extended List widget currently 
supports only one font.
.PP
.SH height
.PP
This is the overall height value assigned to the Extended List widget. Modifying 
this resource will affect scrollbar size and location.
.PP
.SH numColumns
.PP
.SH numRows 
.PP
These resources specify the number of columns and rows the widget expects to 
display. These resources are used as the maximum indices for many of the other 
resources in this widget. Care should be taken when modifying these resources to 
ensure that the other values have also been modified.
.PP
.SH selectedColumn
.PP
This is the index of the currently selected column. This also the column by which 
the list is being sorted.
.PP
.SH selectionPolicy
.PP
Defines the interpretation of the select action. This resource can have the values 
XmSINGLE_SELECT or XmEXTENDED_SELECT. Other values result in 
undefined behavior.
.PP
.SH showFind
.PP
This boolean manages and unmanages the find button
.PP
.SH singleSelectionCallback
.PP
All routines in this list will be called whenever the user clicks on a line in the list. 
A pointer to the Xm18RowInfo structure corresponding to the line selected is passed 
as call_data. If in extended select mode the value of call_data is undefined.
.PP
.SH sortFunctions
.PP
This is an array of functions, one for each column, called to determine the 
ordering of the rows in the column, similar to qsort.
.PP
.SH title
.PP
This is the title that is displayed at the top of the Extended List widget. If this value is NULL, the title area will not be shown.
.PP
.SH width
.PP
This is the overall width value assigned to the Extended List widget. Modifying 
this resource will affect scrollbar size and location.
.PP
.SH Specifying Children Resources
.PP
The Extended List widget is composed of many simple widgets. In order to 
achieve full functionality of the Toolkit, it is sometimes desirable to set attribute 
values directly on those widgets. The widget ids of the sub-widgets can be 
obtained by using the XtNameToWidget() function provided by the Xt 
Intrinsics.

.PP
.SH Using the Resource Database
.PP
The Extended List widget is actually a collection of pieces. It provides the geometry 
layout for the collection as well as tying together the pieces to form a consistent package. 
Many of the resources that are documented as being part of the Extended List 
widget are really part of the internal list sub-component. The Extended List widget 
will pass these values through to the proper child when they are set at time of creation 
or with XtSetValues or XtGetValues. However, when setting a resource via the resource 
database you must use either the name of the child or the general specification 
(*) rather than the specific one (.).
.PP
.SH The Xm18RowInfo Structure
.PP
The Xm18RowInfo structure is used to contain the entryData associated with each Row 
in the Extended List.

values	This is an array of strings of length numColumns which 
represents the strings displayed in each column of this row. The 
data is allocated and maintained by the client. If 
firstColumnPixmaps is True, then value[0] is never referenced.
.HP 15
pixmap	This is the pixmap displayed to the left of this row. If 
firstColumnPixmaps is True then this value is never referenced 
and mayn remain unset. If no pixmap is desired for this row, even 
though firstColumnPixmaps is True, set the value of pixmap to 
None. Color pixmaps may be used.
.HP 15
sort_id	This is provided for the convenience of the client and is expected 
to be used as a sort index for this row. One value should be 
specified for each column of the row. See "sortFunctions" below 
for details.
.HP 15
data	This is provided for the convenience of the client and may be 
used for any purpose. It is intended to be used as an identifier for 
the object pointed to by this row 
.HP 15
selected	This value is True if this row is selected; may be set by the 
application.
.PP
Neither sort_id nor data are used by the Extended List widget; they exist solely for 
the convenience of the programmer.
.PP
.SH Translations and Actions
.PP
The following are the default translation bindings used by the icon button:
.PP
.TS
tab (%);
l l.
~Ctrl ~Shift <Btn1Down>:%ButtonDown()
Ctrl ~Shift <Btn1Down>:%ButtonDown(Toggle)
~Ctrl Shift <Btn1Down>:%ButtonDown(Extend)
Button1 <Motion>:%Motion()
<Btn1Up>:%ButtonUpOrLeave()
.TE
.PP
The following actions are supported by the icon button:
.PP
.SH ButtonDown(type)	
.PP
Processes a button press action that may begin with 
either a select or a double click. The type argument can 
be either Toggle or Extend. These values determine 
which mode of an extended select will be initiated on 
this button event. Consult the OSF/Motif Style 
Guide for details.
.PP
.SH Motion()	
.PP
Processes motion events to allow the selection region to 
be modified when in extended selection mode. It is 
assumed that this action is called between a 
ButtonDown() and ButtonUpOrLeave() action.
.PP
.SH ButtonUpOrLeave() 	
.PP 
Cleans up after ButtonDown() and Motion().
.PP
.SH Callback Routines
.PP
All procedures on the Extended List's singleSelectionCallback and doubleClickCallback 
lists will have a pointer to a Xm18RowInfo structure passed to them in the call_data 
field. This structure is defined above.
.PP
Note: if a single SelectionCallback is registered on an extended list in extended_se-
lect_mode, the value of call_data is undefined.
