/**
 * @brief Generate OS events of a type (FS, Network, Syscall, ioctl).
 *
 * A 'class' of OS events is abstracted into an EventPublisher responsible for
 * remaining as agile as possible given a known-set of subscriptions.
 *
 * The life cycle of an EventPublisher may include, `setUp`, `configure`, `run`,
 * `tearDown`, and `fire`. `setUp` and `tearDown` happen when osquery starts and
 * stops either as a daemon or interactive shell. `configure` is a pseudo-start
 * called every time a Subscription is added. EventPublisher%s can adjust their
 * scope/agility specific to each added subscription by overriding
 *`addSubscription`, and/or globally in `configure`.
 *
 * Not all EventPublisher%s leverage pure async OS APIs, and most will require a
 * run loop either polling with a timeout on a descriptor or for a change. When
 * osquery initializes the EventFactory will optionally create a thread for each
 * EventPublisher using `run` as the thread's entrypoint. `run` is called in a
 * within-thread loop where returning a FAILED status ends the run loop and
 * shuts down the thread.
 *
 * To opt-out of polling in a thread, consider the following run implementation:
 *
 * @code{.cpp}
 *   Status run() { return Status(1, "Not Implemented"); }
 * @endcode
 *
 * The final life cycle component, `fire` will iterate over the EventPublisher
 * Subscription%s and call `shouldFire` for each, using the EventContext fired.
 * The `shouldFire` method should check the subscription-specific selectors and
 * only call the Subscription%'s callback function if the EventContext
 * (thus event) matches.
