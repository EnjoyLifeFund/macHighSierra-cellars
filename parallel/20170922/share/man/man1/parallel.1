\&\s-1STOP\s0!
.PP
Read the \fBReader's guide\fR below if you are new to \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR.
.PP
\&\s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR is a shell tool for executing jobs in parallel using
one or more computers. A job can be a single command or a small
script that has to be run for each of the lines in the input. The
typical input is a list of files, a list of hosts, a list of users, a
list of URLs, or a list of tables. A job can also be a command that
reads from a pipe. \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR can then split the input into
blocks and pipe a block into each command in parallel.
.PP
If you use xargs and tee today you will find \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR very easy to
use as \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR is written to have the same options as xargs. If
you write loops in shell, you will find \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR may be able to
replace most of the loops and make them run faster by running several
jobs in parallel.
.PP
\&\s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR makes sure output from the commands is the same output as
you would get had you run the commands sequentially. This makes it
possible to use output from \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR as input for other programs.
.PP
For each line of input \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR will execute \fIcommand\fR with
the line as arguments. If no \fIcommand\fR is given, the line of input is
executed. Several lines will be run in parallel. \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR can
often be used as a substitute for \fBxargs\fR or \fBcat | bash\fR.
.SS "Reader's guide"
.IX Subsection "Reader's guide"
Start by watching the intro videos for a quick introduction:
http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL284C9FF2488BC6D1
.PP
Then look at the \fB\s-1EXAMPLE\s0\fRs after the list of \fB\s-1OPTIONS\s0\fR (Use
\&\fBLESS=+/EXAMPLE\e: man parallel\fR). That will give you an idea of what
\&\s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR is capable of.
.PP
Then spend an hour walking through the tutorial (\fBman
parallel_tutorial\fR). Your command line will love you for it.
.PP
Finally you may want to look at the rest of this manual if you have
special needs not already covered.
.PP
If you want to know the design decisions behind \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR, try:
\&\fBman parallel_design\fR. This is also a good intro if you intend to
change \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fIcommand\fR" 4
.IX Item "command"
Command to execute.  If \fIcommand\fR or the following arguments contain
replacement strings (such as \fB{}\fR) every instance will be substituted
with the input.
.Sp
If \fIcommand\fR is given, \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR solve the same tasks as
\&\fBxargs\fR. If \fIcommand\fR is not given \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR will behave
similar to \fBcat | sh\fR.
.Sp
The \fIcommand\fR must be an executable, a script, a composed command, an
alias, or a function.
.Sp
\&\fBBash functions\fR: \fBexport \-f\fR the function first or use \fBenv_parallel\fR.
.Sp
\&\fBBash, Csh, or Tcsh aliases\fR: Use \fBenv_parallel\fR.
.Sp
\&\fBZsh, Fish, Ksh, and Pdksh functions and aliases\fR: Use \fBenv_parallel\fR.
.Sp
The command cannot contain the character \e257 (macron: X).
.IP "\fB{}\fR" 4
.IX Item "{}"
Input line. This replacement string will be replaced by a full line
read from the input source. The input source is normally stdin
(standard input), but can also be given with \fB\-a\fR, \fB:::\fR, or
\&\fB::::\fR.
.Sp
The replacement string \fB{}\fR can be changed with \fB\-I\fR.
.Sp
If the command line contains no replacement strings then \fB{}\fR will be
appended to the command line.
.Sp
Replacement strings are normally quoted, so special characters are not
parsed by the shell. The exception is if the command starts with a
replacement string; then the string is not quoted.
.IP "\fB{.}\fR" 4
.IX Item "{.}"
Input line without extension. This replacement string will be replaced
by the input with the extension removed. If the input line contains
\&\fB.\fR after the last \fB/\fR the last \fB.\fR till the end of the string will
be removed and \fB{.}\fR will be replaced with the
remaining. E.g. \fIfoo.jpg\fR becomes \fIfoo\fR, \fIsubdir/foo.jpg\fR becomes
\&\fIsubdir/foo\fR, \fIsub.dir/foo.jpg\fR becomes \fIsub.dir/foo\fR,
\&\fIsub.dir/bar\fR remains \fIsub.dir/bar\fR. If the input line does not
contain \fB.\fR it will remain unchanged.
.Sp
The replacement string \fB{.}\fR can be changed with \fB\-\-er\fR.
.Sp
To understand replacement strings see \fB{}\fR.
.IP "\fB{/}\fR" 4
.IX Item "{/}"
Basename of input line. This replacement string will be replaced by
the input with the directory part removed.
.Sp
The replacement string \fB{/}\fR can be changed with
\&\fB\-\-basenamereplace\fR.
.Sp
To understand replacement strings see \fB{}\fR.
.IP "\fB{//}\fR" 4
.IX Item "{//}"
Dirname of input line. This replacement string will be replaced by the
dir of the input line. See \fBdirname\fR(1).
.Sp
The replacement string \fB{//}\fR can be changed with
\&\fB\-\-dirnamereplace\fR.
.Sp
To understand replacement strings see \fB{}\fR.
.IP "\fB{/.}\fR" 4
.IX Item "{/.}"
Basename of input line without extension. This replacement string will
be replaced by the input with the directory and extension part
removed. It is a combination of \fB{/}\fR and \fB{.}\fR.
.Sp
The replacement string \fB{/.}\fR can be changed with
\&\fB\-\-basenameextensionreplace\fR.
.Sp
To understand replacement strings see \fB{}\fR.
.IP "\fB{#}\fR" 4
.IX Item "{#}"
Sequence number of the job to run. This replacement string will be
replaced by the sequence number of the job being run. It contains the
same number as \f(CW$PARALLEL_SEQ\fR.
.Sp
The replacement string \fB{#}\fR can be changed with \fB\-\-seqreplace\fR.
.Sp
To understand replacement strings see \fB{}\fR.
.IP "\fB{%}\fR" 4
.IX Item "{%}"
Job slot number. This replacement string will be replaced by the job's
slot number between 1 and number of jobs to run in parallel. There
will never be 2 jobs running at the same time with the same job slot
number.
.Sp
The replacement string \fB{%}\fR can be changed with \fB\-\-slotreplace\fR.
.Sp
To understand replacement strings see \fB{}\fR.
.IP "\fB{\fR\fIn\fR\fB}\fR" 4
.IX Item "{n}"
Argument from input source \fIn\fR or the \fIn\fR'th argument. This
positional replacement string will be replaced by the input from input
source \fIn\fR (when used with \fB\-a\fR or \fB::::\fR) or with the \fIn\fR'th
argument (when used with \fB\-N\fR). If \fIn\fR is negative it refers to the
\&\fIn\fR'th last argument.
.Sp
To understand replacement strings see \fB{}\fR.
.IP "\fB{\fR\fIn\fR.\fB}\fR" 4
.IX Item "{n.}"
Argument from input source \fIn\fR or the \fIn\fR'th argument without
extension. It is a combination of \fB{\fR\fIn\fR\fB}\fR and \fB{.}\fR.
.Sp
This positional replacement string will be replaced by the input from
input source \fIn\fR (when used with \fB\-a\fR or \fB::::\fR) or with the
\&\fIn\fR'th argument (when used with \fB\-N\fR). The input will have the
extension removed.
.Sp
To understand positional replacement strings see \fB{\fR\fIn\fR\fB}\fR.
.IP "\fB{\fR\fIn\fR/\fB}\fR" 4
.IX Item "{n/}"
Basename of argument from input source \fIn\fR or the \fIn\fR'th argument.
It is a combination of \fB{\fR\fIn\fR\fB}\fR and \fB{/}\fR.
.Sp
This positional replacement string will be replaced by the input from
input source \fIn\fR (when used with \fB\-a\fR or \fB::::\fR) or with the
\&\fIn\fR'th argument (when used with \fB\-N\fR). The input will have the
directory (if any) removed.
.Sp
To understand positional replacement strings see \fB{\fR\fIn\fR\fB}\fR.
.IP "\fB{\fR\fIn\fR//\fB}\fR" 4
.IX Item "{n//}"
Dirname of argument from input source \fIn\fR or the \fIn\fR'th argument.
It is a combination of \fB{\fR\fIn\fR\fB}\fR and \fB{//}\fR.
.Sp
This positional replacement string will be replaced by the dir of the
input from input source \fIn\fR (when used with \fB\-a\fR or \fB::::\fR) or with
the \fIn\fR'th argument (when used with \fB\-N\fR). See \fBdirname\fR(1).
.Sp
To understand positional replacement strings see \fB{\fR\fIn\fR\fB}\fR.
.IP "\fB{\fR\fIn\fR/.\fB}\fR" 4
.IX Item "{n/.}"
Basename of argument from input source \fIn\fR or the \fIn\fR'th argument
without extension.  It is a combination of \fB{\fR\fIn\fR\fB}\fR, \fB{/}\fR, and
\&\fB{.}\fR.
.Sp
This positional replacement string will be replaced by the input from
input source \fIn\fR (when used with \fB\-a\fR or \fB::::\fR) or with the
\&\fIn\fR'th argument (when used with \fB\-N\fR). The input will have the
directory (if any) and extension removed.
.Sp
To understand positional replacement strings see \fB{\fR\fIn\fR\fB}\fR.
.IP "\fB{=\fR\fIperl expression\fR\fB=}\fR" 4
.IX Item "{=perl expression=}"
Replace with calculated \fIperl expression\fR. \fB\f(CB$_\fB\fR will contain the
same as \fB{}\fR. After evaluating \fIperl expression\fR \fB\f(CB$_\fB\fR will be used
as the value. It is recommended to only change \f(CW$_\fR but you have full
access to all of \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR's internal functions and data
structures. A few convenience functions and data structures have been
made:

.Sp
See also: \fB{=perl expression=}\fR \fB{\fR\fIn\fR\fB}\fR.
.IP "\fB:::\fR \fIarguments\fR" 4
.IX Item "::: arguments"
Use arguments from the command line as input source instead of stdin
(standard input). Unlike other options for \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR \fB:::\fR is
placed after the \fIcommand\fR and before the arguments.
.Sp
The following are equivalent:
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&  (echo file1; echo file2) | parallel gzip
\&  parallel gzip ::: file1 file2
\&  parallel gzip {} ::: file1 file2
\&  parallel \-\-arg\-sep ,, gzip {} ,, file1 file2
\&  parallel \-\-arg\-sep ,, gzip ,, file1 file2
\&  parallel ::: "gzip file1" "gzip file2"
.Ve
.Sp
To avoid treating \fB:::\fR as special use \fB\-\-arg\-sep\fR to set the
argument separator to something else. See also \fB\-\-arg\-sep\fR.
.Sp
If multiple \fB:::\fR are given, each group will be treated as an input
source, and all combinations of input sources will be
generated. E.g. ::: 1 2 ::: a b c will result in the combinations
(1,a) (1,b) (1,c) (2,a) (2,b) (2,c). This is useful for replacing
nested for-loops.
.Sp
\&\fB:::\fR and \fB::::\fR can be mixed. So these are equivalent:
.Sp
.Vb 11
\&  parallel echo {1} {2} {3} ::: 6 7 ::: 4 5 ::: 1 2 3
\&  parallel echo {1} {2} {3} :::: <(seq 6 7) <(seq 4 5) \e
\&    :::: <(seq 1 3)
\&  parallel \-a <(seq 6 7) echo {1} {2} {3} :::: <(seq 4 5) \e

Use \s-1NUL\s0 as delimiter.  Normally input lines will end in \en

.PD
Use \fIinput-file\fR as input source. If you use this option, stdin
(standard input) is given to the first process run.  Otherwise, stdin
(standard input) is redirected from /dev/null.
.Sp
If multiple \fB\-a\fR are given, each \fIinput-file\fR will be treated as an
input source, and all combinations of input sources will be
generated. E.g. The file \fBfoo\fR contains \fB1 2\fR, the file \fBbar\fR
contains \fBa b c\fR.  \fB\-a foo\fR \fB\-a bar\fR will result in the combinations
(1,a) (1,b) (1,c) (2,a) (2,b) (2,c). This is useful for replacing
nested for-loops.

Size of block in bytes to read at a time. The \fIsize\fR can be postfixed

.Sp
\&\s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR tries to meet the block size but can be off by the

Remove down hosts. For each remote host: check that login through ssh

For performance reasons, this check is performed only at the start and

Currently you can \fInot\fR put \fB\-\-filter\-hosts\fR in a profile,

Buffer output on line basis. \fB\-\-group\fR will keep the output together
for a whole job. \fB\-\-ungroup\fR allows output to mixup with half a line
coming from one job and half a line coming from another
job. \fB\-\-line\-buffer\fR fits between these two: \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR will
print a full line, but will allow for mixing lines of different jobs.

process an infinite amount of data, but it will buffer on disk when

job while it is running, then lines from the second job while that is

\&  Remove all extensions
\&  \-\-rpl \*(Aq{:} s:(\e.[^/]+)*$::\*(Aq
.Ve
.Sp
You can have dynamic replacement strings by including parenthesis in
the replacement string and adding a regular expression between the
parenthesis. The matching string will be inserted as $$1:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&  parallel \-\-rpl \*(Aq{%(.*?)} s/$$1//\*(Aq echo {%.tar.gz} ::: my.tar.gz

The simplest solution to grep a big file for a lot of regexps is:

.PP
Or if the regexps are fixed strings:
.PP

.PP
There are 3 limiting factors: \s-1CPU, RAM,\s0 and disk I/O.
.PP
\&\s-1RAM\s0 is easy to measure: If the \fBgrep\fR process takes up most of your
free memory (e.g. when running \fBtop\fR), then \s-1RAM\s0 is a limiting factor.
.PP
\&\s-1CPU\s0 is also easy to measure: If the \fBgrep\fR takes >90% \s-1CPU\s0 in \fBtop\fR,
then the \s-1CPU\s0 is a limiting factor, and parallelization will speed this
up.
.PP
It is harder to see if disk I/O is the limiting factor, and depending
on the disk system it may be faster or slower to parallelize. The only
way to know for certain is to test and measure.
.SS "Limiting factor: \s-1RAM\s0"
.IX Subsection "Limiting factor: RAM"
The normal \fBgrep \-f regexs.txt bigfile\fR works no matter the size of
bigfile, but if regexps.txt is so big it cannot fit into memory, then
you need to split this.
.PP
\&\fBgrep \-F\fR takes around 100 bytes of \s-1RAM\s0 and \fBgrep\fR takes about 500
bytes of \s-1RAM\s0 per 1 byte of regexp. So if regexps.txt is 1% of your
\&\s-1RAM,\s0 then it may be too big.
.PP
If you can convert your regexps into fixed strings do that. E.g. if
the lines you are looking for in bigfile all looks like:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  ID1 foo bar baz Identifier1 quux
\&  fubar ID2 foo bar baz Identifier2
.Ve
.PP
then your regexps.txt can be converted from:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  ID1.*Identifier1
\&  ID2.*Identifier2
.Ve
.PP
into:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  ID1 foo bar baz Identifier1
\&  ID2 foo bar baz Identifier2
.Ve
.PP
This way you can use \fBgrep \-F\fR which takes around 80% less memory and
is much faster.
.PP
If it still does not fit in memory you can do this:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  parallel \-\-pipepart \-a regexps.txt \-\-block 1M grep \-Ff \- \-n bigfile |
\&    sort \-un | perl \-pe \*(Aqs/^\ed+://\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
The 1M should be your free memory divided by the number of cores and
divided by 200 for \fBgrep \-F\fR and by 1000 for normal \fBgrep\fR. On
GNU/Linux you can do:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  free=$(awk \*(Aq/^((Swap)?Cached|MemFree|Buffers):/ { sum += $2 }
\&              END { print sum }\*(Aq /proc/meminfo)
\&  percpu=$((free / 200 / $(parallel \-\-number\-of\-cores)))k
\&

\&    grep \-F \-f \- \-n bigfile |
\&    sort \-un | perl \-pe \*(Aqs/^\ed+://\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
If you can live with duplicated lines and wrong order, it is faster to do:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  parallel \-\-pipepart \-a regexps.txt \-\-block $percpu \-\-compress \e
\&    grep \-F \-f \- bigfile
.Ve
.SS "Limiting factor: \s-1CPU\s0"
.IX Subsection "Limiting factor: CPU"
If the \s-1CPU\s0 is the limiting factor parallelization should be done on
the regexps:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  cat regexp.txt | parallel \-\-pipe \-L1000 \-\-round\-robin \-\-compress \e
\&    grep \-f \- \-n bigfile |
\&    sort \-un | perl \-pe \*(Aqs/^\ed+://\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
The command will start one \fBgrep\fR per \s-1CPU\s0 and read \fIbigfile\fR one
time per \s-1CPU,\s0 but as that is done in parallel, all reads except the
first will be cached in \s-1RAM.\s0 Depending on the size of \fIregexp.txt\fR it
may be faster to use \fB\-\-block 10m\fR instead of \fB\-L1000\fR.
.PP
Some storage systems perform better when reading multiple chunks in
parallel. This is true for some \s-1RAID\s0 systems and for some network file
systems. To parallelize the reading of \fIbigfile\fR:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  parallel \-\-pipepart \-\-block 100M \-a bigfile \-k \-\-compress \e
\&    grep \-f regexp.txt
.Ve
.PP
This will split \fIbigfile\fR into 100MB chunks and run \fBgrep\fR on each of
these chunks. To parallelize both reading of \fIbigfile\fR and \fIregexp.txt\fR
combine the two using \fB\-\-fifo\fR:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  parallel \-\-pipepart \-\-block 100M \-a bigfile \-\-fifo cat regexp.txt \e
\&    \e| parallel \-\-pipe \-L1000 \-\-round\-robin grep \-f \- {}

\&\fBgzip\fR works fine if the output is appended, but some processing does

\&\s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR can work as a simple job queue system or batch manager.
The idea is to put the jobs into a file and have \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR read

use \fBtail\fR to continue reading:

\&\s-1GNU\s0 Parallel discovers if \fBjobfile\fR or \fB~/.parallel/sshloginfile\fR

There is a a small issue when using \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR as queue
system/batch manager: You have to submit JobSlot number of jobs before
they will start, and after that you can submit one at a time, and job
will start immediately if free slots are available.  Output from the
running or completed jobs are held back and will only be printed when
JobSlots more jobs has been started (unless you use \-\-ungroup or
\&\-\-line\-buffer, in which case the output from the jobs are printed
immediately).  E.g. if you have 10 jobslots then the output from the
first completed job will only be printed when job 11 has started, and
the output of second completed job will only be printed when job 12
has started.

and depending on context these needs to be quoted, too:

However, when you want to use a shell variable you need to quote the
$\-sign. Here is an example using \f(CW$PARALLEL_SEQ\fR. This variable is set
by \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR itself, so the evaluation of the $ must be done by
the sub shell started by \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR:

.Vb 2
\&  VAR=this_is_set_before_starting
\&  echo test | parallel echo {} $VAR
.Ve
.PP
Prints: \fBtest this_is_set_before_starting\fR

If the special characters should not be evaluated by the sub shell

.Ve

This is particularly useful if you have lots of quoting. If you want to run a perl script like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  perl \-ne \*(Aq/^\eS+\es+\eS+$/ and print $ARGV,"\en"\*(Aq file

Notice how spaces, \e's, "'s, and $'s need to be quoted. \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR
can do the quoting by using option \-q:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  ls | parallel \-q  perl \-ne \*(Aq/^\eS+\es+\eS+$/ and print $ARGV,"\en"\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
However, this means you cannot make the sub shell interpret special
characters. For example because of \fB\-q\fR this \s-1WILL NOT WORK:\s0
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  ls *.gz | parallel \-q "zcat {} >{.}"
\&  ls *.gz | parallel \-q "zcat {} | bzip2 >{.}.bz2"
.Ve
.PP
because > and | need to be interpreted by the sub shell.
.PP
If you get errors like:
.PP

\&  sh: \-c: line 0: unexpected EOF while looking for matching \`\*(Aq\*(Aq

.PP
then you might try using \fB\-q\fR.
.PP
If you are using \fBbash\fR process substitution like \fB<(cat foo)\fR then
you may try \fB\-q\fR and prepending \fIcommand\fR with \fBbash \-c\fR:
.PP
.Vb 1

.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.IX Header "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.ie n .IP "$PARALLEL_HOME" 9
.el .IP "\f(CW$PARALLEL_HOME\fR" 9
.IX Item "$PARALLEL_HOME"
Dir where \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR stores config files, semaphores, and caches
information between invocations. Default: \f(CW$HOME\fR/.parallel.
.ie n .IP "$PARALLEL_PID" 9
.el .IP "\f(CW$PARALLEL_PID\fR" 9
.IX Item "$PARALLEL_PID"
The environment variable \f(CW$PARALLEL_PID\fR is set by \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR and
is visible to the jobs started from \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR. This makes it
possible for the jobs to communicate directly to \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR.
Remember to quote the $, so it gets evaluated by the correct
shell.
.Sp
\&\fBExample:\fR If each of the jobs tests a solution and one of jobs finds
the solution the job can tell \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR not to start more jobs
by: \fBkill \-TERM \f(CB$PARALLEL_PID\fB\fR. This only works on the local
computer.
.ie n .IP "$PARALLEL_RSYNC_OPTS" 9
.el .IP "\f(CW$PARALLEL_RSYNC_OPTS\fR" 9

.ie n .IP "$PARALLEL_SSH" 9
.el .IP "\f(CW$PARALLEL_SSH\fR" 9
.IX Item "$PARALLEL_SSH"
\&\s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR defaults to using \fBssh\fR for remote access. This can
be overridden with \f(CW$PARALLEL_SSH\fR, which again can be overridden with
\&\fB\-\-ssh\fR. It can also be set on a per server basis (see
\&\fB\-\-sshlogin\fR).
.ie n .IP "$PARALLEL_SEQ" 9
.el .IP "\f(CW$PARALLEL_SEQ\fR" 9
.IX Item "$PARALLEL_SEQ"
\&\f(CW$PARALLEL_SEQ\fR will be set to the sequence number of the job

.Sp
\&\fBExample:\fR
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  seq 10 | parallel \-N2 \e
\&    echo seq:\*(Aq$\*(AqPARALLEL_SEQ arg1:{1} arg2:{2}
.Ve
.ie n .IP "$PARALLEL_TMUX" 9
.el .IP "\f(CW$PARALLEL_TMUX\fR" 9
.IX Item "$PARALLEL_TMUX"
Path to \fBtmux\fR. If unset the \fBtmux\fR in \f(CW$PATH\fR is used.
.ie n .IP "$TMPDIR" 9
.el .IP "\f(CW$TMPDIR\fR" 9
.IX Item "$TMPDIR"
Directory for temporary files. See: \fB\-\-tmpdir\fR.
.ie n .IP "$PARALLEL" 9
.el .IP "\f(CW$PARALLEL\fR" 9
.IX Item "$PARALLEL"
The environment variable \f(CW$PARALLEL\fR will be used as default options for
\&\s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR. If the variable contains special shell characters
(e.g. $, *, or space) then these need to be to be escaped with \e.
.Sp
\&\fBExample:\fR
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  cat list | parallel \-j1 \-k \-v ls
\&  cat list | parallel \-j1 \-k \-v \-S"myssh user@server" ls
.Ve

.Vb 3
\&  cat list | PARALLEL="\-kvj1" parallel ls
\&  cat list | PARALLEL=\*(Aq\-kvj1 \-S myssh\e user@server\*(Aq \e
\&    parallel echo
.Ve
.Sp
Notice the \e in the middle is needed because 'myssh' and 'user@server'
must be one argument.
.SH "DEFAULT PROFILE (CONFIG FILE)"
.IX Header "DEFAULT PROFILE (CONFIG FILE)"
The global configuration file /etc/parallel/config, followed by user
configuration file ~/.parallel/config (formerly known as .parallelrc)
will be read in turn if they exist.  Lines starting with '#' will be
ignored. The format can follow that of the environment variable
\&\f(CW$PARALLEL\fR, but it is often easier to simply put each option on its own
line.
.PP
Options on the command line take precedence, followed by the
environment variable \f(CW$PARALLEL\fR, user configuration file
~/.parallel/config, and finally the global configuration file
/etc/parallel/config.
.PP
Note that no file that is read for options, nor the environment
variable \f(CW$PARALLEL\fR, may contain retired options such as \fB\-\-tollef\fR.
.SH "PROFILE FILES"
.IX Header "PROFILE FILES"
If \fB\-\-profile\fR set, \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR will read the profile from that
file rather than the global or user configuration files. You can have
multiple \fB\-\-profiles\fR.
.PP
Example: Profile for running a command on every sshlogin in
~/.ssh/sshlogins and prepend the output with the sshlogin:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  echo \-\-tag \-S .. \-\-nonall > ~/.parallel/n
\&  parallel \-Jn uptime
.Ve
.PP
Example: Profile for running every command with \fB\-j\-1\fR and \fBnice\fR
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  echo \-j\-1 nice > ~/.parallel/nice_profile
\&  parallel \-J nice_profile bzip2 \-9 ::: *

Example: Profile for running a perl script before every command:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  echo "perl \-e \*(Aq\e$a=\e$\e$; print \e$a,\e" \e",\*(Aq\e$PARALLEL_SEQ\*(Aq,\e" \e";\*(Aq;" \e
\&    > ~/.parallel/pre_perl
\&  parallel \-J pre_perl echo ::: *
.Ve
.PP
Note how the $ and " need to be quoted using \e.
.PP
Example: Profile for running distributed jobs with \fBnice\fR on the
remote computers:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  echo \-S .. nice > ~/.parallel/dist
\&  parallel \-J dist \-\-trc {.}.bz2 bzip2 \-9 ::: *

.SH "EXIT STATUS"
.IX Header "EXIT STATUS"
Exit status depends on \fB\-\-halt\-on\-error\fR if one of these are used:
success=X, success=Y%, fail=Y%.
.IP "0" 6
All jobs ran without error. If success=X is used: X jobs ran without
error. If success=Y% is used: Y% of the jobs ran without error.
.IP "1\-100" 6
.IX Item "1-100"
Some of the jobs failed. The exit status gives the number of failed
jobs. If Y% is used the exit status is the percentage of jobs that
failed.
.IP "101" 6
.IX Item "101"
More than 100 jobs failed.
.IP "255" 6
.IX Item "255"
Other error.
.IP "\-1 (In joblog and \s-1SQL\s0 table)" 6
.IX Item "-1 (In joblog and SQL table)"
Killed by Ctrl-C, timeout, not enough memory or similar.
.IP "\-2 (In joblog and \s-1SQL\s0 table)" 6
.IX Item "-2 (In joblog and SQL table)"
\&\fIskip()\fR was called in \fB{= =}\fR.
.IP "\-1000 (In \s-1SQL\s0 table)" 6

\&\s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR is slow at starting up \- around 250 ms the first time
and 150 ms after that.
.PP
\fIJob startup\fR
.IX Subsection "Job startup"
.PP
Starting a job on the local machine takes around 10 ms. This can be a
big overhead if the job takes very few ms to run. Often you can group
small jobs together using \fB\-X\fR which will make the overhead less
significant. Or you can run multiple \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fRs as described in
\&\fB\s-1EXAMPLE:\s0 Speeding up fast jobs\fR.
.PP
\fI\s-1SSH\s0\fR
.IX Subsection "SSH"
.PP
When using multiple computers \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR opens \fBssh\fR connections
to them to figure out how many connections can be used reliably
simultaneously (Namely \s-1SSHD\s0's MaxStartups). This test is done for each
host in serial, so if your \fB\-\-sshloginfile\fR contains many hosts it may
be slow.
.PP
If your jobs are short you may see that there are fewer jobs running
on the remove systems than expected. This is due to time spent logging
in and out. \fB\-M\fR may help here.
.PP
\fIDisk access\fR
.IX Subsection "Disk access"
.PP
A single disk can normally read data faster if it reads one file at a
time instead of reading a lot of files in parallel, as this will avoid
disk seeks. However, newer disk systems with multiple drives can read
faster if reading from multiple files in parallel.
.PP
If the jobs are of the form read-all-compute-all-write-all, so
everything is read before anything is written, it may be faster to
force only one disk access at the time:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  sem \-\-id diskio cat file | compute | sem \-\-id diskio cat > file
.Ve
.PP
If the jobs are of the form read-compute-write, so writing starts
before all reading is done, it may be faster to force only one reader
and writer at the time:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  sem \-\-id read cat file | compute | sem \-\-id write cat > file
.Ve
.PP
If the jobs are of the form read-compute-read-compute, it may be
faster to run more jobs in parallel than the system has CPUs, as some
of the jobs will be stuck waiting for disk access.
.SS "\-\-nice limits command length"
.IX Subsection "--nice limits command length"
The current implementation of \fB\-\-nice\fR is too pessimistic in the max
allowed command length. It only uses a little more than half of what
it could. This affects \fB\-X\fR and \fB\-m\fR. If this becomes a real problem for
you file a bug-report.
.SS "Aliases and functions do not work"
.IX Subsection "Aliases and functions do not work"
If you get:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  Can\*(Aqt exec "command": No such file or directory
.Ve
.PP
or:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  open3: exec of by command failed
.Ve
.PP
it may be because \fIcommand\fR is not known, but it could also be
because \fIcommand\fR is an alias or a function. If it is a function you
need to \fBexport \-f\fR the function first. An alias will only work if
you use \fBenv_parallel\fR.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"

.PP
See a perfect bug report on

.PP
Your bug report should always include:
.IP "\(bu" 2
The error message you get (if any). If the error message is not from
\&\s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR you need to show why you think \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR caused
these.
.IP "\(bu" 2
The complete output of \fBparallel \-\-version\fR. If you are not running
the latest released version (see http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/parallel/) you
should specify why you believe the problem is not fixed in that
version.
.IP "\(bu" 2
A minimal, complete, and verifiable example (See description on
http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve).
.Sp
It should be a complete example that others can run that shows the problem
including all files needed to run the example. This should preferably
be small and simple, so try to remove as many options as possible. A
combination of \fByes\fR, \fBseq\fR, \fBcat\fR, \fBecho\fR, and \fBsleep\fR can
reproduce most errors. If your example requires large files, see if
you can make them by something like \fBseq 1000000\fR > \fBfile\fR or \fByes
| head \-n 10000000\fR > \fBfile\fR.
.Sp
If your example requires remote execution, see if you can use
\&\fBlocalhost\fR \- maybe using another login.
.Sp
If you have access to a different system, test if the \s-1MCVE\s0 shows the
problem on that system.
.IP "\(bu" 2
The output of your example. If your problem is not easily reproduced
by others, the output might help them figure out the problem.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Whether you have watched the intro videos
(http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL284C9FF2488BC6D1), walked
through the tutorial (man parallel_tutorial), and read the \s-1EXAMPLE\s0
section in the man page (man parallel \- search for \s-1EXAMPLE:\s0).
.PP
If you suspect the error is dependent on your environment or
distribution, please see if you can reproduce the error on one of
these VirtualBox images:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualboximage/files/
http://www.osboxes.org/virtualbox\-images/
.PP
Specifying the name of your distribution is not enough as you may have
installed software that is not in the VirtualBox images.
.PP
If you cannot reproduce the error on any of the VirtualBox images
above, see if you can build a VirtualBox image on which you can
reproduce the error. If not you should assume the debugging will be
done through you. That will put more burden on you and it is extra
important you give any information that help. In general the problem
will be fixed faster and with less work for you if you can reproduce
the error on a VirtualBox.
