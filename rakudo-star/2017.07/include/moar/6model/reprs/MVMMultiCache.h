/* The multi-dispatch cache is a set of trees keyed on the address of
 * an interned callsite. The tree is represented as  an array of triples,
 * each having the form (action, match, no-match). The match and no-match
 * are either:
 *   * Positive, and an index into the array for what to check next
 *   * Zero, meaning we failed to find a match
 *   * Negative, meaning we found a match, and should negate the index
 *     to get a the resulting candidate
 *
 * The first MVM_MULTICACHE_HASH_SIZE entries in the array are tree roots.
 * They are all set to have a NULL callsite matcher when there's no tree
 * there, implying an immediate match failure.
 *
 * The matcher starts in callsite match mode, meaning that the matcher is
 * the memory address of a callsite. This naturally handles hash collisions.
 *
 * Once we have a matching callsite, it flips into argument matching mode.
 * The lowermost bits of the action represent the index into the arguments
 * buffer for the argument we need to test. The next bit is for concrete or
 * not. The bit after it is rw or not. The remaining bits correspond to the
 * STable's type cache ID.
 *
 * The construction of the tree is such that we only have to test the first
 * argument until we get a match, then the second, etc. This means that common
 * prefixes are factored out, keeping the tree smaller. The use of a single
 * block of memory is also aimed at getting good CPU cache hit rates.
 *
 * The tree array is immutable, and so can safely be read by many threads, and
 * kept in thier CPU caches. Upon a new entry, the cache will be copied, and the
 * tweaks made. The cache head pointer will then be set to the new cache, and the
 * old cache memory scheduled for freeeing at the next safepoint.
