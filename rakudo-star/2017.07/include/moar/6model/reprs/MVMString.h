/* Representation used by VM-level strings.
 *
 * Strings come in one of 3 forms today, with 1 expected future form:
 *   - 32-bit buffer of graphemes (Unicode codepoints or synthetic codepoints)
 *   - 8-bit buffer of codepoints that all fall in the ASCII range
 *   - Buffer of strands
 *   - (LATER) 8-bit buffer of codepoints with negatives as synthetics (we
 *     draw out a distinction with the ASCII range buffer because we can do
 *     some I/O simplifications when we know all is in the ASCII range).
 *
 * A buffer of strands represents a string made up of other non-strand
 * strings. That is, there's no recursive strands. This simplifies the
 * process of iteration enormously. A strand may refer to just part of
 * another string by specifying offsets. Furthermore, it may specify a
 * repetition count.
