=TITLE class Num

=SUBTITLE Floating-point number

    class Num is Cool does Real { }

A C<Num> object stores a floating-point number. It is immutable. On most
platforms, it's an IEEE 754 64-bit floating point numbers, aka "double
precision".

=head2 NaN

The value X<C<NaN>|NaN (definition)> is an instance of C<Num> and represents a
float point not-a-number value. It is defined and boolifies to True. C<NaN> is
the result of undefined float point number operations and depends on the CPU or
software implementation of float point numbers on the system running the code.

=head2 method rand

    method rand(Num:D: --> Num)

Returns a pseudo random number between 0 and the invocant.

=head2 sub srand

    sub srand(Int $seed --> Int:D)

Seeds the pseudo random number generator used by L<Num.rand|/type/Num#rand> with
the provided value. Note that C<srand> is called with a platform dependent
value when a PerlÂ 6 program is started.
