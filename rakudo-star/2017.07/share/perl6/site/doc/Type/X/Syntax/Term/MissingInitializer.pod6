=SUBTITLE Compilation error due to declaring a term without initialization

    class X::Syntax::Term::MissingInitializer does X::Syntax { }

Syntax error when a term (a backslash variable) is declared without
initialization assignment.

For example

=for code :skip-test
my \foo;

dies with

=for code :skip-test
===SORRY!===
Term definition requires an initializer

Valid code would be

    my \foo = 42;

=end pod
