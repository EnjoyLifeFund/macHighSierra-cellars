  Version 2.0.8 (18-Jul-2008)

  The GNU shtool program is a compilation of small but very stable and
  portable shell scripts into a single shell tool. All ingredients
  were in successful use over many years in various free software
  projects. The compiled shtool program is intended to be used inside
  the source tree of free software packages. There it can take over
  various (usually non-portable) tasks related to the building and
  installation of such packages.

  It currently contains the following tools:

  echo       Print string with optional construct expansion
  mdate      Pretty-print modification time of a file or dir
  table      Pretty print a field-separated list as a table
  prop       Display progress with a running propeller
  move       Move files with simultan substitution
  install    Install a program, script or datafile
  mkdir      Make one or more directories
  mkln       Make link with calculation of relative paths
  mkshadow   Make a shadow tree
  fixperm    Fix file permissions inside a source tree
  rotate     Rotate logfiles
  tarball    Roll distribution tarballs
  subst      Apply sed(1) substitution operations
  platform   Platform identification utility
  arx        Extended archive command
  slo        Separate linker options by library class
  scpp       Sharing C Pre-Processor
  version    Generate and maintain a version information file
  path       Deal with program paths
