	Report from Karl.

2010-06-25  Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.init, NEWS, formats/*.init: change the external_ref 
	API, fourth argument is now the file name and add the node as an 
	extra argument.
	Simplify default external references, use section name or
	cross references or node name, and use printed manual name or 
	info manual name, report from Karl.

2010-06-25  Karl Berry  <karl@gnu.org>

	* addformats.sh,
        * buildt2h.sh: add copyright notice,
        and insert generation identification in output.
	* Makefile.am: add copyright notice.

2010-06-23  Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: add variable substitution in htmlxref.cnf. Karl

	split manuals. Report from Karl.
	* po_*/*: update to a more recent gettext.

2010-06-22  Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: format the key of index entries as late as possible
	allowing for example to take into account --enable-encoding.
	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: Add a new map for sorted strings, 
	%sorting_things_map, to avoid taking into account the sorting in 
	%texi_map. For example @copyright can now be (C) while it is C 
	in sorting_things_map. Report by Karl.

2010-06-22  Karl Berry  <karl@gnu.org>

	* texi2html.pl: sectionning has one n in English.

2010-06-21   Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* formats/plaintext.init: when doing plaintext or info with 
	--headers, don't set the output to be STDOUT if already set and is
	not a directory. Report from Karl.

2010-06-21   Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: in htmlxref.cnf, a comment is now ^\s*# instead
	of # followed by a space anywhere on the line. Report from Karl.

2010-06-20   Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: set the command name to texi2any when it is not
	a known command name (ie $0 or --program is not texi2html, 
	makeinfo or texi2any). Report from Karl.

2010-06-12   Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.init, texi2html.pl, formats/html.init: new output
	configuration variable, currently only used in html,
	$DATE_IN_HEADER to have the generation date output in headers. 
	Report from Benno Schulenberg.

2010-04-24   Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* formats/docbook.init: don't format @b and @i as lineannotation
	in preformatted output, report from Per Bothner.

2010-04-21   Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: really initialize state when formatting special
	regions outside of document.

2010-04-03   Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: @part is stopped by an appendix.
	Use part as section target, if the section is associated with 
	a part.

2010-03-31   Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: handle part in html. 
	@part are associated with the following sectionning command,
	like @chapter.
	nodes associated with @part are associated with this sectionning
	command too. 
	@part are not included in the toplevelnext and toplevelprev 
	chains and these directions are used for node next and prev, 
	bypassing @part.
	* formats/html.init: add a rule after a @part.
	* texi2html.init: add back some default definitions for 
	all the layout subroutines, in case they are used in user-defined 
	functions and not defined in the default format.

2010-03-28   Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, formats/info.init, formats/docbook.init, 
	formats/xml.init: handle @part in info, xml and docbook.
	* texi2html.pl, formats/docbook.init, formats/xml.init: 
	use childnext, the next child element of an element, instead
	of sectionnext to determine if an element has to be closed
	in docbook or xml. This fixes the tree when there is first a
	low-level element before an upper level element.

2010-03-20   Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: new option --program to change defaults
	according to that option.
	* texi2html.init: treat raw text format as a regular
	format, with an initialization function.
	Don't double the prepended text in itemize if it is 
	an @-command and don't do anything with 
	%special_list_commands.

2010-03-16   Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: error out when there are multiple @menu in 
	a node. Fix http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?8432.
	* texi2html.init: prepend a ; to thorn entity.
	* formats/docbook.init: no &lsaquo; nor &rsaquo;, replace with
	&gt;, &lt;.
	* Makefile.am: always create the i18n directory.
	Do a specific target for the po_document file to run update-po,
	report from Karl.
	Distribute gettext_to_separated.pl.

2010-03-13  Karl Berry  <karl@gnu.org>

	* texi2html.pl: mention perl -x for running from the srcdir.
	Suggestion from Patrice.

2010-03-02   Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* formats/html.init: prevent breaks on - and _ in @w.

2010-03-01   Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init, formats/html.init: handle
	@allowcodebreaks in html by enclosing the word containing - 
	or _ in white-space:pre style. Idea from Mark Polesky.

2010-02-23   Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* configure.ac, texi2html.pl: use more runtime detection. Report
	from Karl.

2010-02-21   Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* Makefile.am: regenerate the .gmo files for tests in check-local
	not all-local.
	* texi2html.pl: expand correctly datarootdir.
	Bind the domains of the messages to the directory they are 
	installed into.

2010-02-21   Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* configure.ac, Makefile.am: take po files from above directory
	(where texinfo po files are) if the source wasn't configured
	in the texi2html toplevel directory.
	* texi2html.init: add some unicode character transliteration
	to get the same test results in case unidecode is not installed.
	* test/*: set the WIDTH in latex2html generated files to 100
	otherwise it may be different of one unit between platforms.
	A possible cause may be platform dependent rounding used to
	determine the WIDTH based on image width in latex2html.

2010-02-20   Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* Makefile.am, i18n/*, separated_to_hash.pl, gettext_to_separated.pl:
	generate automatically i18n hashes from po files.

2010-02-07   Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* configure.ac, NEWS: change the release number to 5.0, to match
	the next texinfo release.

2010-02-07   Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* formats/info.init: handle @w rightly, by considering everything
	in @w to be a pending word, even the spaces.
	* formats/html.init: handle @w correctly in html.
	* i18n/es, po_document/es.us-ascii.po: fix some accented characters 
	in the Spanish translations (Francisco Vila).
	* *Makefile*: use automake 1.11.1.

2010-01-22   Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* formats/info.init: don't munge punctuation when in code style
	command, @dots, @var, @cite, or a simple_style command.
	Ignore @emph, @strong and other style commands better, even if 
	they lead to a begin or end string and even if there are 
	info_default_after_punctuation_characters in following commands.
	info_default_leaf_command are simple simple_style commands.
	* texi2html.init: more simple_style command and @w isn't a 
	simple_style command.

2010-01-20   Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, formats/info.init: use string width when
	necessary, not character number. 
	Fix http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?28359.
	* texi2html.init: use Unicode::EastAsianWidth to determine string 
	width. Use it for section titles, fixing the original issue in
	http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?28359.
	* Makefile.am, configure.ac, lib: ship Unicode::EastAsianWidth to 
	always be able to use an internal copy.

2010-01-19   Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: in get_conf take into account the values in 
	Texi2HTML::GLOBAL, this allows using get_conf sooner.
	Runtime configuration variable, USE_NLS for nls support.
	Prepare for character width handling with Unicode::EastAsianWidth.
	New command handler, @command_handler_names, after second pass, but
	before element names expansions.
	* texi2html.init: use @command_handler_names to set things_map 
	to the encoded character if ENABLE_ENCODING is set, such that
	the encoded characters are used in node and section names.
	Don't call t2h_default_set_out_encoding in init_out, since it was
	already called earlier in the main program.
	* formats/info.init: count bytes and not characters for nodes,
	anchor and file offsets.
	Very partial fix of http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?28359.

2010-01-10   Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: don't open a paragraph when a specially handled
	command that doesn't open a paragraph is encountered.
	This leads to constructs badly rendered, with a paragraph opened
	right after the @end tex, like
	
	With:

	@tex
	a = b/c
	@end tex
	.@*

	However, without the first newline, the result is right.
	* formats/info.init: handle commands specially handled in info.

2010-12-28   Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* po_document/hu.po, po_document/it.po: hungarian 
	translation (DÃ©nes Harmath) and italian translation 
	(Federico Bruni).
	* po_document/ja.utf-8.po: remove the utf-8 part of the 
	filename since it prevents conversion to other encodings.
	* texi2html.init, texi2html.pl: set $OUT to undef in the
	default case, such that it is determined by $SPLIT.

2009-12-27   Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: decode translated strings in perl internal format.

2009-12-24   Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.init,*/*.init: more messages setup to be translated.

2009-12-22   Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: more messages setup to be translated.

2009-12-21   Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: use makeinfo messages for @if* commands.

2009-12-20   Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: handle better @verb{ not closed in listoffloats.
	Error for empty nodes. 
	Use t_0 for basename when the node consists in spaces after @-command
	expansions.

2009-12-19   Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: keep line number information for settitle and
	similar functions formatting and output error messages.

2009-11-23   Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* formats/html.init: @format is not indented.
	Prepare the indentation using CSS for complex formats.
	Default to using CSS indentation, except for html32.init
	(following Thomas Keller idea).
	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init, */*.init:  complex format handling 
	API changed. $complex_format_map is replaced by a real hash 
	%complex_format_map and the begin and end are no more evaluated.
	* maintained_extra/mediawiki.init: use preformatted formats
	indentation in CSS. Don't add a div for each preformatted, but only
	for the whole format.

2009-11-22   Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.init: don't execute commplex format string if it is
	an empty string.

2009-11-21   Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, formats/info.init: add anchors for index entries
	in special regions, with the region name in the anchor.
	Avoid using @index_labels.
	Handle better unknown index entry commands.

2009-11-15   Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: error if @headitem is used inside @table.
	Handle double @top.
	* texi2html.pl, formats/*.init: handle @author in 
	@quotation and warn for author outside of @quotation and
	@titlepage.
	* configure.ac, Makefile.am, po_*/POTFILES.in.in, po_*/Makevars.in:
	Add some paths set in configure in POTFILES.in.in and Makevars.in 
	to workaround gettext not automatically setting top_builddir.

2009-11-11   Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.init: add maps for TeX/LaTeX with a complete 
	coverage for @-commands in math style. Add a function 
	default_load_tex_math to load those and expand @-commands
	in math as LaTeX or TeX.
	* examples/mediawiki.init: expand @-commands in math as
	LaTeX.
	* examples/mediawiki.init: moved to maintained_extras now
	that it is complete.

2009-11-08   Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl formats/*: more adjustments to error messages
	to be like makeinfo.

2009-11-04   Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.init texi2html.pl formats/*: set up translations 
	for error messages, reusing all the makeinfo messages that are 
	relevant.

2009-11-01   Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, i18n/*, po_document, manage_i18n.pl.in, *: 
	instead of using %{ } for translation arguments, use { } as 
	known by libintl-perl and gettext. 
	Use gdt() instead of &$I() to mark strings to be translated
	to be able to use xgettext to find strings. 
	Use a gettext-like framework using libintl-perl for in document 
	string translations. The old i18n framework can still be 
	activated by setting $I18N_PERL_HASH.
	Remove non ascii characters that crept in coments.
	* configure.ac, Makefile.am: support libintl-perl external and 
	internal and gettext.
	* lib/: copy libintl-perl to be sure that it is available, and
	also to have a consistent behaviour (different gettext 
	implementations do things differently).

2009-10-30  gettextize  <bug-gnu-gettext@gnu.org>

	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Add po_messages, po_document.
	(ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS): New variable.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Add config.rpath.
	* configure.ac (AC_CONFIG_FILES): Add po_messages/Makefile.in
	and po_document/Makefile.in.

2009-10-29   Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* configure.ac, test/*: split node names in test that lead to 
	long out files, to be able to use tar-ustar instead of tar-pax.
	* texi2html.pl, Makefile.am: distinguish config files directories 
	and init files directories. For config files directories use the 
	command name. For init files also prepend a directories 
	like *texinfo/init and append CONF_DIRS.

2009-10-26   Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, T2h_l2h.pm, maintained_extra/tex4ht.init:
	call twice the extraction of html to have something ready for
	the special regions formatting and also allow to have modifications
	of the file like in mediawiki.init (report of tex_in_copying failing
	from Jean-Charles Malahieude).
	* Makefile.am, doc/Makefile.am: modify to be able to build
	texi2html as part of another package (in texinfo).
	* texi2html.init: handle right --prefix in info.

2009-10-20   Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.init, texi2html.pl, T2h_l2h.pm, maintained_extra/tex4ht.init: 
	split tex handling further, with html extraction done in 
	@command_handler_output such that it is possible to modify the
	resulting files after 'process' and before 'output'.
	Add newlines between TeX fragments.
	If L2H_SKIP is 0, cache is not used.
	* examples/mediawiki.init: use html2wiki between 'process' and 
	before 'output' to translate the html produced by tex4ht or 
	latex2html to wiki.

2009-10-19   Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* formats/*.init: don't strip {} in @math in html, docbook and 
	xml, as agreed with Karl.

2009-10-16   Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: @math is also in code_style.
	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init, */*.init: 
	change in the normal_text function reference API, now there is an 
	input variable true if in @math. Same in thing_command and 
	simple_command.
	* examples/mediawiki.init: handle @image, @uref, @math, @kbd,
	@indicateurl, @abbr, footnotes.

2009-10-14   Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init, formats/*: add 'inline_attribute' 
	for an XML attribute that should be closed at paragraph end and 
	reopened at paragraph begin. Consequently the closing and opening 
	of 'attribute' isn't done anymore in paragraph and preformatted.
	Add a new interface for substitutions in normal text, with 
	t2h_add_text_substitutions, t2h_remove_text_substitutions,
	@text_substitutions_normal, @text_substitutions_texi,
	@text_substitutions_simple_format, @text_substitutions_pre and
	t2h_text_substitutions.
	USE_ISO now only determines if '', `` --- and -- are transformed
	into entities. t2h_default_set_iso_symbols sets or unsets USE_ISO,
	%things_map/%pre_map/%simple_format_simple_map_texi, 
	$OPEN_QUOTE_SYMBOL and $CLOSE_QUOTE_SYMBOL.
	%iso_symbols is unused now.
	Transform ' and ` when doing utf8 text and in simple_formats.
	Set correctly $Texi2HTML::THISDOC{'line_nr'} in substitute_text.
	* T2h_i18n.pm: ensures that %@{something@} really leads to 
	%{something}. This means that @{ in a string to be translated will
	always be rendered as {, whatever the format. Having a @{ in a 
	translated string, however, should hopefully not happen.
	* doc/texi2html.texi: remove the old string interface for style
	commands from the documentation. Support for this interface is
	untested since a long time. The new interface is documented since
	2004-01-19 (release 1.68).
	* examples/mediawiki.init: more use of wikitext instead of 
	html. 
	Warn for characters that shouldn't appear in mediawiki
	titles and references.
	* maintained_extra/chm.init: avoid entities in .hh* files.

2009-10-06   Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init, formats/html.init: add the 
	possibility to disable CSS with NO_CSS and have styles inline with
	INLINE_CSS_STYLE.
	Use INLINE_CSS_STYLE in mediawiki.init and NO_CSS in html32.init.

2009-10-04   Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: add a new hook for users, command_handler_setup
	that is really called before anything is done.
	Add 'inline_end' and 'inline_begin' for styles to allow for
	markup that has to be restarted or closed at each paragraph break
	(that is already done for atributes).
	* texi2html.init, formats/*: print_element_header is obsoleted, 
	things should be done in element_heading or print_head_navigation.
	New function references, heading_text and heading_text_preformatted
	allowing to have more generic function references.
	More generic inline_contents, titlepage print_title heading and
	element_heading (merged texi2html.init and html.init versions).
	Add SHOW_TITLE to determine whether the title is print out or not.
	* examples/mediawiki.init: more wiki links using targets with 
	spaces.

2009-09-23   Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: use @code for index entries that should be 
	in @code that are not in usual places and so couldn't be 
	gathered in pass 2.
	Distinguish 'expansion', like index entry, or caption in
	various contexts and real regions like @copying and @titlepage,
	that are 'region'.
	Don't use 'hidden' in a index entry ref for hidden index
	entries, instead flag entries that were not seen and are in 
	a region. Entries that are in an 'expansion' may be expanded
	more than once and are also not collected.
	Warn for anchors that are ignored because they are in a region
	that is expanded more than once.

2009-09-22   Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: if a closed file is reopened, echo a warning
	and open in append mode.
	Avoid overwriting files when doing misc elements.

2009-09-22   Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: if there is a Top node, warn if the first node
	doesn't appear in menus.
	Handle file counter of added index files like files from the
	main program (in case a file name collides, tested in 
	same_doc_nr_split_index_and_element.texi).
	Use the element cross-reference name (also used as anchor)
	as file name when NODE_FILENAMES is true, and there is no 
	associated node.

2009-09-21   Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: Don't use authors and subtitles to hold the 
	texinfo strings, but use authors_texi and subtitles_texi. 
	Obsolete the use of values to hold the command texinfo strings.
	Don't always set the Up of the toplevel elements to the 
	element_top.

2009-09-20   Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: isolate the code related with index split
	such that it is called only if SPLIT_INDEX is set.
	Always change file after and before the top element since
	it uses the docu_top file.
	Increase the index file number only when needed, not for
	every the elements, when node names are used for filenames.

2009-09-18   Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: use global information for @printindex not
	split.
	Try to give correct file name to close_out.

2009-09-17   Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: use global information for @printindex not
	associated with any element.

2009-09-16   Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: hold the index entries gathered 
	in pass 2 by index name in an array instead of a hash.
	Do the sorting by letter in the main program and use per index
	array or hash to hold and use the entry sorted by letter.

2009-09-15   Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: split do_simple to avoid redundant condition
	checking.
	Keep line numbers within nested styles.
	Uncomment --command handling for now.
	Use scan_line_separators to parse @float and @quotation lines
	instead of 'cmd_line'.
	Remove dead code related with cmd_line and obsolete end of line 
	protection code.
	Give a context string for substitute_text.
	Better menu entry parsing.
	Consistently remove comments and spaces at the end of line
	@-command arguments.
	Pass empty index entries and empty letters down to the last pass.
	* formats/html.init: better-looking menu entries.

2009-09-11   Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* formats/docbook.init, formats/xml.init: remove the useless

	* texi2html.init: don't treat especially heading of the node
	that also happens to be in the element_top, and don't replace

	USE_UNIDECODE are not set.
	* test/encoding/*: tests for transliteration with all possibilities.

2008-12-23  Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: don't use unidecode on unicode characters that
	are known not to have a good transliteration. This corresponds with
	characters with an @-command that don't have a transliteration, like
	@exclamdown...

	commands enclosing 2 paragraphs.

2008-11-11  Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.init: set %simple_map_texi = %ascii_simple_map. 
	@ followed by a newline or a tab should be replaced by a space.

2008-11-10  Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.init: add support for @ogonek.
	* texi2html.init, texi2html.pl: encode correctly texi dumped.

2008-11-08  Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.init, texi2html.pl: move index splitting code back to
	texi2html.pl, but still in the Config namespace, to mark clearly
	that this code is GPL. summary_letter is also put in texi2html.pl
	since it share a variable at file scope.
	* examples/*: add copyright notices to most init files, except 
	xml.init and book.init that should remain as an example users can 
	copy from.

2008-11-03  Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.init: remove leading spaces and trailing spaces in 
	multitable cells.
	* texi2html.pl: do human-readable id for toc, and different id
	for stoc.
	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init, examples/makeinfo.init: with 
	OVERVIEW_LINK_TO_TOC set, overview links to toc as in makeinfo.

2008-11-01  Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.init: don't do paragraphs in multitables.
	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: handle @smallquotation, change 
	quotation_prepend_text and quotation function reference APIs.
	* texi2html.init: put a table line in <tt> if and only if there is
	a code-like environment enclosing the construct.
	* texi2html.pl: warn if the menu order doesn't follow the sectionning
	order.

2008-11-01  Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: associate node with the right file,
	even if after section and split index. 
	Handle better empty @elements_list.

2008-09-25  Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: associate nodes that are not already associated 
	with the top node in case only sections are used.
	* texi2html.init: associate elements in split indices to the 
	split indice added element.

2008-09-24  Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: remove THIS_HEADER. Instead 
	everything goes to THIS_SECTION. New function reference, 
	element_heading, to format a node or a section heading, including
	navigation and label. Accordingly, print_Top and one_section don't
	print the element header anymore.
	print_element_header and print_navigation now return their result.
	new argument for print_misc and print_misc_header, the misc page
	name.
	labels and headings appear where the command is, instead of always 
	appearing at the beginning of the elements.

2008-09-23  Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl,texi2html.init: do added index pages in 
	texi2html.init. Add an element for an index page only it begins 
	a new file. Avoid changing directions as best as possible, while 
	still linking to the added index element (with Following, Back and 
	Prev). Never consider printindex as elements, but instead put them
	in places.

2008-09-07  Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: always use a distinct label for index 
	entries, and use id, target like for other placed items.
	Give more informations for index entry formatting.

2008-09-06  Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: when node Top is considered as a @top, don't
	associate the following nodes to it, but rather to the next
	section.
	When there is no section and USE_NODES is not set don't split
	by node.
	Split only by node when USE_SECTIONS is not set and USE_NODES
	is. Default for USE_SECTIONS is 1, and default for USE_NODES
	is now undef.
	When there is no texinfo sectionning element at all or no 
	element for texi2html (for example no section but 
	USE_SECTIONS == 1 and USE_NODES undef).
	always use THIS_SECTION and THIS_HEADER such that formatting
	functions can modify them.
	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: progress towards index formatting
	simplification and handling out of the main program.

2008-09-04  Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: don't consider Top node is like @top when 
	finding automatic directions for nodes.
	And use up node for up if element is a node, instead of relying on
	the section the node is within.
	Use toplevelnext and toplevelprev when finding node directions for
	sections not associated with nodes.

2008-09-03  Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: add prepare_state_multiple_pass function to ease
	formatting more than once specific texts (in index entries, prepended
	in @itemize, @caption formatting outside of document...) as if
	they were in special regions (@copying, @titlepage...).
	* examples/docbook: create valid docbook in @?(v|f)table taking 
	into account the strictness of docbook.
	Remove title for text before first item, docbook handles right
	anything before the real table beginning.

2008-09-02  Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: section names and headings cross
	ref are now human readable and constructed using the section name.
	Better index summary letters and index page labels that also
	ensures that there is no clash with node labels.
	* texi2html.init: when split at node, output navigation heading 
	even when SECTION_NAVIGATION is true, but never output navigation
	footings.

2008-08-31  Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: only one @title should appear in
	a document. So now, what was title before is fulltitle.
	Simplify fulltitle determination, now try @settitle first.
	@shortittle doesn't exist.
	Accept more than one file on the command line.
	Config variables are read-only after command line switches
	expansion. If defined, they set $Texi2HTML::THISDOC{'VAR'}
	and if not defined, $Texi2HTML::THISDOC{'VAR'} is autodetected.
	$Texi2HTML::THISDOC{'VAR'} is then used in the code.
	Better handling of 8byte encodings.
	Generate human readable index labels.
	Fix element_target_name return result order (report from Reinhold).
	* texi2html.init: Modify elements formatting functions such that they 
	call print_foot_navigation instead of doing the formatting themselves,
	and also such that they never call print_navigation directly.
	This is more consistent with the docs.
	* test/many_input_files: test for more than one file on the 
	command line.

2008-08-29  Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: expand macros and value in all the @-commands that
	need to. Also treat as normal text more @-commands.
	More places with code_style, as agreed on bug-texinfo.
	Don't normalize spaces in images.
	Protect text in @verb in simple_format.
	As said on the texinfo list in menu only the node is in code_style.
	Transliterate index entries in index labels.
	* i18n/es: new translation from Francisco Vila.

2008-08-26  Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, examples/makeinfo.init: put everything needed for
	footnote formatting in the footnote state, to be able to use it in
	formatting function. This allows to mimic the makeinfo formatting
	of footnotes.
	* texi2html.pl, doc/*: add function references to be able to modify
	target and id for elements, placed items and nodes (Reinhold
	suggestion).
	* texi2html.pl: initialize file relative foot number to 0 (report
	from Reinhold).
	Fix numbering of numbered subsections in unnumbered such that every
	numbered section has an increasing number.
	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: @display and @format inherit the 
	code_style and font.
	* examples/book.init: better conformant ouput.

2008-08-25  Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: modify menu preformatted handling
	such that the preformatted needs not be done in the formatting 
	function. This allowed to remove simple_menu_link since now
	menu_link is always like simple_menu_link with detection of
	commands added. Now things should be right in html, and also
	xml, and with SIMPLE_MENU even for complicated nestings in 
	menus.
	Give to formatting functions for formats like @itemize, @table,
	@multitable... the information that the element is before the first
	@item, or that only commands listed in %inter_item_commands
	were seen.
	Always call $heading when a heading is seen, even if it is not
	associated with the element.
	* texi2html.init: Keep better original code end of lines in 
	@def* and put the anchor at the definition line beginning.

2008-08-21  Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: simplify handling of table and list items, get
	rid of table_list_stack, instead use the regular stack.
	Close all formats closed by end of line (center and table term)
	at end of line.
	Don't call scan_line recursively in close_stack.
	Keep the styles to be reopened in next paragraphs in close_paragraph
	and not in close_stack.
	Now format_style{'table'} is only for (|v|f)table.

2008-08-20  Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: parse correctly menu node with name.
	Simplify deff item opening.
	Handle *headingmarks, *footingmarks.

2008-08-19  Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: images don't start a paragraph.
	@* is better as a new line with remove texi.
	Allow to have @insertcopying simply pasted during the second pass
	with INLINE_INSERTCOPYING.
	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init, examples/*: pass all the files found
	for images.
	* docbook.init: correct @image handling and other fixes.
	* test/*: adapt to cvs and regenerate.

2008-08-18  Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.init: in the default case, don't complete image paths
	as suggested by Reinhold. It is what makeinfo does, completing
	paths is confusing and use case is dubious. Complete paths 
	if $COMPLETE_IMAGE_PATHS is set.
	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: remove the possibility to have
	format_in_paragraph for any @-commands, but only for raw 
	@-commands. Otherwise the nesting may be messed up, if
	such command is closed in the middle of a paragraph, or a paragraph
	is closed in the middle of such command.
	Give simple_text formatted output for special region formatting.
	* texi2html.pl: accept accent commands followed by spaces for 
	accent command not consisting in special characters.
	Handle better documents without elements.
	Never use $_ (report from Reinhold).
	* l2h.init: move to ...
	* examples/l2h.init: comment out variables that override the
	command line.
	* examples/enable_encoding.init: new init file, should do the 
	same than makeinfo --enable-encoding.
	* test/: test suite replacing the old one in Test, with better
	design and the same files used, + texinfo test files.

2008-08-14  Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: only use the basename when dumping texi.
	Really use what is in Texi2HTML::Config::CONF_DIRS, including
	during command line arguments parsing.

2008-08-13  Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: don't mess the relative working directory by
	removing most of it (report from Reinhold).
	If the --out argument is a directory, and not splitting, this
	is considered to be the out directory and the out file is the
	manual name.
	* Tests/*: enhance and correct the test suite.

2008-08-09  Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: use the global formatting state in definitions
	argument formatting.
	Correct the max_columns count with @columnfractions.
	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: handle @: with punctuation
	character.
	* examples/docbook.init: new backend for docbook to produce 
	docbook like makeinfo --docbook.

2008-08-08  Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: use relative file names for hrefs for misc 
	elements (patch from Reinhold Kainhofer reinhold at kainhofer
	dot com). And also to determine if the file has to be reopened
	(report from Reinhold).

2008-08-07  Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: move initialisations before the functions that
	use the global values.
	Treat setfilename like a normal misc command, not like titlepage
	commands.
	Set rightly (dir) as up node for Top, even if there are no automatic
	directions.
	region lines are kept to be reparsed in the last pass if in
	%region_formats_kept.
	Give also the prototypes lengths for multitables.
	@-commands in stop_paragraph_command close paragraphs.
	external nodes begin with ( (report from Reinhold).
	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: With USE_SETFILENAME, the filename 
	is taken from @setfilename, if found, like makeinfo.
	With IGNORE_BEFORE_SETFILENAME, everything before @setfilename is 
	ignored (now the default).
	With TOP_HEADING_AT_BEGINNING false, the top heading appears where
	top heading command is, not always at the beginning of the top
	element.
	Put %texi_formats_map (former %text_macros) and 
	%no_line_commands (former %no_line_macros) in Texi2HTML::Config.
	New function reference, definition_index_entry to format definition
	index entries separately from definition categories.
	A new funtion reference begin_format_texi to be able to do something
	at a format opening. Used to set a stack for multitable to make 
	sure that the cell is the top multitable cell. With this change, the
	begin_format_texi, row, table_list function reference are
	interdependent.
	Pass inforef macros to the formatting references, and also the *ref
	command parameters unmodified.
	New caption_shortcaption_command function reference that can be used
	when a caption is closed.
	New index_entry_command function reference used for @*index lines.
	Pass more information to def_line, cell, list_item and many others.
	add insertcopying for insertcopying formatting.
	* examples/xml.init: init file to produce xml like makeinfo --xml.

2008-08-04  Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: parse definition lines like makeinfo
	does.

2008-08-01  Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: pass line_nr down more functions.

2008-07-31  Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: use simple_format for image alt text.
	Allow no_line_macro to be set by the user, and use cindex for
	all the index commands.

2008-07-30  Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: add 3 function references to avoid
	using anchor for different label formatting and allows to customize
	the labels.
	Give the element in argument of more function references.
	Always give the name to simple_menu_link and menu_link, and a new 
	argument tells if there was an explicit name.
	Node names are formatted with code_style true.
	Keep @*contents for misc_command processing if it should be kept.

2008-07-29  Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: a menu comment is started by a blank line, and not
	by a character at the beginning of the line.

2008-07-28  Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: handle a menu_comment like a normal
	format. detailmenu isn't a misc_command anymore, but is handled like a
	normal format, like a menu @-command.
	put format opening in a separate subsection, begin_format, to be
	able to open a menu_comment right after a beginning of a menu, of
	a detailmenu, or right after the end of those commands.
	add command line option --error-limit.
	* texi2html.pl: better comment about texi2html that states more 
	clearly that the authors are the texi2html authors (from Reinhold
	Kainhofer).
	Handle better codepoints above 0xFFFF (Reinhold Kainhofer report).
	Add $Texi2HTML::THISDOC{'input_file_name'} for the file given on the 
	command line (report from Reinhold Kainhofer).

2008-07-19  Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, doc/*: synchronize command-line switches with 
	makeinfo.
	* i18n/fr, Tests/*: revised french translation from Jean-Charles
	Malahieude.

2008-07-18  Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: get rid of m_cedilla, instead a specific function
	for the node parsing, scan_node_line, is used.
	* Tests/formatting/detailmenus.texi: new test case for detailmenu.

2008-07-16  Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: give columnfractions and row
	prototypes to the multitable cell and row formatting functions.
	* texi2html.init: use columnfractions to determine the cell
	widths.

2008-06-12  Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: dynamically determine file hrefs for
	misc elements. Generalize code common for all misc elements. 
	In toc and footnotes use real filenames instead of empty filenames 
	when not split.
	monolithic option is not obsolete and does something different from 
	no split (toc, about... are in different files if set to no).
	Code cleanups in rearrange_elements.
	* Tests/*: add a test for -no-monolithic.
	* */Makefile.in: use autoconf 2.62

2008-05-18  Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.init: complete unicode mapping for @-commands.
	* texi2html.pl, Tests/*, doc/*: separate id of element from what
	should be used to target the element. This allows to 
	use node id as target for sections (suggestion from Karl Berry). 
	This is done if $USE_NODE_TARGET is set (the default).

2008-05-16  Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* T2h_i18n.pm,i18n/*: correct the presentation of the date (report
	from Karl Berry).
	* texi2html.pl: remove an infinite loop workaround, the up for an
	element should never be itself. This has certainly be fixed on
	2008-03-20, by treating top like any other element.

2008-05-15  Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.init, Tests/*, examples/*: handle @leq and @geq.

2008-03-25  Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: use do_unknown and unknown in pass 0 too.
	* texi2html.init, examples/makeinfo.init: honor USE_ACCESSKEY
	even if not split at node (report from Reinhold Kainhofer).
	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init, ChangeLog: correct typo in 
	already (report from Reinhold Kainhofer).

2008-03-23  Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init, doc/*, examples/makeinfo.init: 
	use accesskey attribute and link element if set in the init file.
	Add FileNext and FilePrev directions (for link, but can be used
	anywhere).
	* texi2html.pl, examples/*: change in unknown function reference API,
	now there is a pass argument to be able to handle unknown macros in 
	other passes than the last.
	* i18n/de: update translation (Reinhold Kainhofer).
	* texi2html.pl, doc/*: handle frame files like other files, and
	document them.
	* texi2html.pl, doc/*: use do_unknown and unknown in pass 1 too.

2008-03-20  Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: treat the @top element like any section element, 
	except that the previous chapter is still considered to be the 
	previous element at its level.
	Find previous and next toplevel better.
	* Makefile.am,...: better handling of mediawiki tests and regenerate
	with automake 1.10.1.

2008-03-17  Patrice Dumas  <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: @itemize should produce bullets by
	default (report from Reinhold Kainhofer, and bugfix)
	* texi2html.init: handle @click, @clickstyle, @click, @arrow,
	@clicksequence
	* texi2html.pl: defer setting the date after all initializations
	are done.
	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init, doc: TOC_LIST_ATTRIBUTE replaced by
	NO_BULLET_LIST_ATTRIBUTE, TOC_LIST_STYLE replaced by 
	NO_BULLET_LIST_STYLE
	* Tests/formatting/comments.texi,formatting.texi,clean.texi:
	test for @click, @clickstyle, @click, @arrow, @clicksequence

	rename some hash keys to avoid hash keys name clashes.
	revert a change in merge_element_before_anything such that it is
	only done for the first node.
	more duplicate_stack when giving the state to a formatting
	function. This has the added benefit that it sets the command_stack
	at preformatted beginning to the current command_stack, which is right
	in thoses case (it is done by begin_paragraph in other cases).
	protect end of lines with @
	only for deff, and in that case protect it better.
	remove unneeded spaces added during close_stack.

	* texi2html.pl: take into account the equivalent nodes (after
	@-commands removal) when a node isn't found.
	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: new variable $TOP_NODE_UP used

	remove -i18n switch. 
	parse source files to extract strings to be translated.
	complete these strings with the element of %$template_strings
	in manage_i18n.pl and fill the i18n/template file with 
	these strings in the 'en' language hash.
	With the 'all' arg given to manage_i18n.pl the template is 
	regenerated the language files are updated and merged in 
	translations.pl. translations.pl is pasted in texi2html.pl.
	give arguments to the string to be translated: when something
	like %{arg} appears in the string and { 'arg' => 'some string'}
	is given as second argument, %{arg} is replaced by 'some string'

2003-09-06  Patrice Dumas <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, T2h_i18n.pm, texi2html.init: new handling of 
	languages in documents.
	instead of using the hash reference $Texi2HTML::I18n::WORDS for
	translation of words, call &Texi2HTML::I18n::get_string (more
	precisely use &$I, a reference on the function). The strings
	are the real english strings and not identifiers.
	The date formatting depends on the language.
	Use translations for months and not a months array.
	Put translations in one file per language and not in T2h_i18n.pm.
	Those files are in the i18n directory. They are to be concatenated
	in the file translated.pl which is required or pasted in texi2html.
	Add a switch -i18n for the specification of a management command
	related with internationalization: if the command is merge, 
	the files in the i18n directory are concatenated into translated.pl;
	if the command is update the files are updated with their own 
	informations and the list of valid strings appearing in T2h_i18n.pm,
	invalid strings are obsoleted but kept.
	* test.sh: add a test for internationalization.

2003-09-05  Patrice Dumas <pertusus@free.fr>

	by appending the text appearing on the format command line.
	Use %special_list_commands to inhibit calling the formatting command
	on an item in a given format command.
	if '-' is given to the -output option, output on STDOUT.
	Find more format command mismatches, and handle better formats not
	closed.

2003-09-02  Patrice Dumas <pertusus@free.fr>

	Simplify the handling of tables. The default is to use %format_map
	or otherwise a user defined function, $table_list.
	All the css commands are in %css_map. 'pre_style' in $complex_formats
	is taken from %css_map.
	handle @sp.
	Remove $Texi2HTML::STOC_LINES (use $Texi2HTML::OVERVIEW), remove
	$Texi2HTML::TOC (use $Texi2HTML::TOC_LINES), remove $T2H_TOP.
	use references on arrays everywhere (instead of arrays) for
	Texi2HTML::OVERVIEW and Texi2HTML::TOC_LINES.
	Use OVERVIEW consistently.
	use $docu_top when needed, instead of $docu_name.$docu_ext, which
	is wrong if -o is used.
	prepare index entries label text in main program.
	rewrite from scratch most of the function in .init files to put 
	them in the public domain.
	expand macros in macro arguments.
	\ protects @end macro in macros body. This may be wrong.
	ignore space and newline following a region opening command.
	rename -css-file to -css-include.
	Add 'This' to the hashes for buttons, icons and so on.
	Add option -toc-links, create links from headings to toc entries
	with 9 lines from 
	Martin Herbert Dietze <martin@the-little-red-haired-girl.org>
	macros are expanded in macro arguments, taking care of context (in
	@verbatim, @ignore, @comment...).

	Reenable handling of -idx-sum.
	* Tests/*: add tests for macros expansion in macro arguments, and
	for command line option style which are not default.

2003-08-29  Derek Price  <derek@ximbiot.com>

	* doc/stamp-vti, doc/version.texi: Regenerated.

2003-08-11  Patrice Dumas <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.init, texi2html.pl: don't always open paragraphs 
	in tables and such, only when needed.
	option -output obsoletes -out_file and -subdir. It is the
	same than -out_file when output is not split, and the same than
	-subdir when it is split.
	Handle empty indices.
	Handle better @-commands with letters mixed with other characters.
	Be more carefull about NUMBER_SECTION, such that nothing is numbered
	when it is false.

	* doc/*: add a section about installation and make the manual more
	makeinfo friendly. 

2003-08-04  Patrice Dumas <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.init, Tests/test.sh, Tests/ccvs: don't expand info
	section in default settings. Expand info sections for the xemacs
	manual, the viper manual and the texinfo manual. 
	The cvs manual is updated.

2003-08-04  Patrice Dumas <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: pass line numbers to all the 
	functions echoing error messages and use these line numbers
	in error messages. Some error messages rewrited.
	Correct tag for sectionning commands in case raisesection or
	lowersection were used.
	-P option prepends before the document directory, and use an
	array, @Texi2HTML::Config::PREPEND_DIRS.
	Add options --ifhtml, --ifinfo and so on (similar with makeinfo
	options). It is also possible not to expand html now.
	Add entries for xml.
	when a region is expanded the corresponding ifnot region isn't.
	Add support for -css-file option which does the same than in 
	makeinfo (parse the file, and echo the @import part before the
	texi2html css rules, the rules part after the texi2html css rules).
	If split at node and NODE_FILES is true but USE_NODES is not,
	the correct file nema is used for nodes not associated with
	sections and a redirection file is made.
	ignore spaces or not for def*index, pagesizes, syn*index properly.

2003-08-04  Patrice Dumas <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: don't remove empty line in the 
	second pass, pass_structure.
	collect line numbers/file name/macro expanding text in pass_texi.
	pass these informations down to pass_structure.
	take care of arguments not provided in some @-commands (no file
	in @image, no node in @inforef and so on).
	remove unneeded code in macro text expansion.
	remove leading spaces and newlines in macros arguments.
	add support for @\ (ignore).
	put code extracted from texi2html.pl and placed in texi2html.init,

	Document the API between texi2html.pl and texi2html.init, i.e.
	document how the formatting functions called by texi2html.pl
	should behave.
	add print_section_header to format section headers.

2003-08-01  Patrice Dumas <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: add option '-noexpand' as a synonym for '-no-expand'
	like Derek suggested.

2003-07-31  Derek Price  <derek@ximbiot.com>

	* texi2html.pl (T2H_OPTIONS->{'no-expand'}): Remove useless linkage.

2003-07-31  Patrice Dumas <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: A new option -no-expand which does 
	the reverse of -expand.
	Text before the first @node or sectionning command is 
	outputted as part of the first section. A new option enables the 
	reverse: if -ignore-preamble-text is set (variable 
	$IGNORE_PREAMBLE_TEXT) this text is ignored.
	Handle macros appearing in that part of texinfo files (@direntry
	and @dircategory ignored, @shorttitlepage handled).
	Ignore everything at the beginning of the file until \input or an
	@-command preceded by optionnal spaces.
	better handling of @titlefont.

2003-07-29  Patrice Dumas <pertusus@free.fr>
	
	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: if split, top and misc elements (about,
	toc, ...) always have a bottom navigation panel.
	If there is no @top and the @node Top isn't associated with any section
	it is considered to be the top element.
	The top name is Top when there is no name nor title (previously was
	"Untitled Document").
	bugfix: top element handled as top even when it is the last element.

2003-07-22  Patrice Dumas <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init, examples/*: add support for @cartouche
	and @titlefont.
	preliminary support for css. All the element needing style have a 
	class attribute. The commands which are associated with a class by
	makeinfo have that class too. The styles are in the <head> in <style>.
	A new init file, inlinestyle.init, should be used when style 
	attributes within html elements are wanted.
	A new option, "-U value" does the same than "@clear value" (makeinfo
	has that option, too).
	A new configuration variable L2H_HTML_VERSION for the html version 
	passed to latex2html.
	@tex or @math don't start a new paragraph.
	* Tests/*: test for @raisesections and @lowersections, and for 
	@cartouche.

2003-07-11  Patrice Dumas <pertusus@free.fr>

	* Tests/ccvs: update cvs manual. This should fixe the issue of rcs 
	tags expanding in html manual files in ccvs_res.
	* Tests/*: sync with code. Add missing test result files.
	* Tests/Makefile.am: add new test subdirs. Better cleaning.
	* l2h.init: add init file for latex2html.

2003-07-10  Derek Price  <derek@ximbiot.com>

	* Tests/nodes_texinfo/--and-hyphenation.html: Removed this accidentally
	added file at Pat's request.

2003-07-10  Patrice Dumas <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, Tests/test.sh: command line option names use '-' 
	instead of '_' between words (for example dump_texi becomes dump-texi).
	* Tests/*: remove unneeded html and passfirst files.

2003-07-03  Patrice Dumas <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, *.init: use a separate namespace for the config
	variables: Texi2HTML::Config. Use the Texi2HTML:: namespace for
	variables set in texi2html and used in the init files subroutines.
	Use Texi2HTML::LaTeX2HTML namespace for latex2html related code.
	Use Texi2HTML::I18n namespace for internationalisation.
	Variables related with latex2html are removed from texi2html.init
	and put in l2h.init.
	harmonize function names style (all like get_index and not GetIndex).
	* Makefine.am, texi2html.pl: install examples init files in shared 
	directory.
	try to find init files in the current directory, then the .texi2html 
	user directory, the local texi2html directory and lastly the shared
	texi2html directory.

2003-06-17  Patrice Dumas <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: error messages go to STDERR instead of STDIN
	* Tests/test.sh: add -x to perl invocation to avoid perl trying
	to execute @PERL@. Small fixes.

	include of files within lines expanded from macros happen
	at the right place
	better handling of format command in section names and of empty 
	raw formats (like @html@end html)
	* Tests/*: sync with code
	
2003-05-20  Patrice Dumas <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: split pass_texi in 2 pass. pass_texi
	rearranges texi expanding macros and values, removing comments.
	pass_structure remove unneeded empty lines and find out the structure
	of the document.
	use a different formatting for menu entries in other environments than 
	menus.
	cleaning of code.
	use close_stack in all the passes to close environments not rightly
	closed. Fix some places where stack wasn't closed rightly.
	New direction, 'NodeNext' and 'NodePrev' which contains the prev node 
	and next node which may be different from Next and Prev for sections.
	use style font-size:smaller in pre instead of <font> for smallexample 
	and friends to produce valid html.
	spaces and arguments following commands are removed or kept in the 
	same way than makeinfo does.
	* Tests/*: add tests for environments not closed. Sync with code.

2003-05-09  Patrice Dumas <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: refs to other manuals conforms to 
	makeinfo with separated files for nodes.
	If  $T2H_NODE_FILES (-node-files) is true one file per node is created
	which redirects to the real file or is the node file (if T2H_SPLIT
	at node), to allow for cross manual references.
	Add a T2H_NO_TEXI hash similar with T2H_HREF, T2H_NODES...
	and T2H_THISDOC{title_no_texi} to have a texi free and thus html free
	text for nodes/sections/title to be used in the <title> which element
	which cannot contain other html elements. Also usefull for files with
	node names generation.
	t2h_set_body_text and t2h_protect_html put in texi2html.init to be
	able to make changes more easily.
	$T2H_TOC_LIST_STYLE is used for style in toc. Makes customisation
	easier too.
	* examples/html32.init: init file for html 3.2 generation
	* Tests/test.sh: add validation
	* Tests/*: tests for files with node names generation

2003-05-07  Patrice Dumas <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: put a label in splitted index.
	splitted indices which are not at the level of splitting are kept
	in the same file but in different sections.
	different horizontal rules are global variables.
	functions formatting index summary and index entry split between 
	a function in texi2html.pl and smaller functions doing the real
	formatting in texi2html.init.
	no formatting is done in texi2html.init.
	heading appears in documents with only one section.
	if $T2H_SEPARATED_FOOTNOTES is false (-noseparated_footnotes)
	the footnotes are on the page they appear. More possibility
	of customization of footnotes (insert things before and after each
	footnotes and all footnotes).
	use top file for the top element even when there is no @top section.
	when there is a top element and splitting, no other element than
	the top element appear in the top file.
	* examples/makeinfo.init: format footnotes like makeinfo
	* examples/xhtml.init: init file for xhtml
	* Tests/test.sh: little fixes
	* Tests/*: all tex stuff taken from verbatim_html and put in tex.texi.
	tests for index entries in top and before top.
	tests for documents with only one section or node or no node.

2003-05-02  Patrice Dumas <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: 3 split commands: split at
	chapter, section or for every node (previously node and section 
	where the same than node now).
	specific section footer.
	find prev and next like makeinfo.
	new directions, for nodes: NodeUp (up for node) and Following (next
	node in reading order).
	if in detailmenu menu entries are not used to find next and prev.
	only one Top in nodes and anchors. Any case combination accepted
	for any reference.
	don't close { when not associated with an @command.
	reintroduced code for counting words.
	new possibilities for buttons. If this is a ref to a scalar, the
	text appears in navigation. If it is an array, the first element
	is a direction used for the href, the second element is a scalar
	ref for the text (see makeinfo.init in examples for an example).
	* Tests/*: test for recursive nodes references and other little
	tests
	* examples/*: new directory for examples of config files. There
	is a file which tries to have an output which looks like makeinfo
	--html output (makeinfo.init).

2003-04-30  Patrice Dumas <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: add the node as element when there 
	is a @printindex split accross pages between node and section.
	* Tests/*: tests for documents with indices in top and between node
	and section.

2003-04-29  Patrice Dumas <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: add $T2H_MENU_SYMBOL before nodes in 
	menu and optionnaly before unnumbered section names in menu entry.
	next are not menu childs but next node in menu.
	it is possible not to have next or prev for node.
	any case combination of top is accepted in nodes, menus and 
	nodes directions. Not changed in anchors and refs (makeinfo shows
	that kind of inconsistencies too).
	the top_element it the @top section, then the Top node 
	and last the first element.
	'(file) node' and '(file)' accepted in menus and nodes references.
	better looking verbose output.
	* Tests/*: tests for documents without sections and double top

2003-04-28  Patrice Dumas <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: No heading for top, as print_Top 
	already does it.
	if $T2H_USE_NODES (command line -use-nodes) is set, the nodes are
	used as sections when they are not associated with a section.
	find sections structure before handling nodes.
	no more use of menu level for structuring.
	@html sections don't close paragraphs.
	* Tests/*: tests for document structure. Sync with code.

2003-04-23  Patrice Dumas <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: when there is no section nodes are used instead
	* .cvsignore: add autom4te-2.53.cache and check_texinfo.pl
	* Tests/.cvsignore: create .cvsignore for Tests
	* Tests/ccvs: update to latest cvs manual

2003-04-22  Patrice Dumas <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: constants declared early as they are used in 
	texi2html.init (at least $WARN is used)
	* Makefile.in, Tests/Makefile.in, Tests/Makefile.am: add .passfirst  
	and .2 files in regenerate and clean
	* Tests/*: results of tests added

2003-04-10  Patrice Dumas <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: labels were put 2 times in special
	sections (Top, about, toc...).
	in vtable, ftable and table, even with an empty first item we
	begin a <dd> as only <dd> and <dt> are allowed to follow <dl>.
	Right labels are put in special sections and files are omitted
	when the href is on the same file.
	change &#156; to &oelig; and &#140; to &OElig; (as tidy do)
	* Tests/*/nodetest.texi: test for more simple special commands

2003-04-09  Patrice Dumas <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: formatting put in texi2html.init
	hrefs to anchors and index entries which are in footnotes are right
	scan_texi changed to have a stack
	verbose and debug goes to STDERR
	unusefull empty lines removed
	new option -dump_texi used to debug, dumps the result of pass_texi
	to a file
	menu_comments are always preformatted
	better handling of @math and @sc
	* Tests/*: a little more things tested.

2003-04-04  Patrice Dumas <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: deffn and the like better handled
	preformatted sections are closed when there is a new format
	and reopened right after the format such that there is no
	validation error. The preformatted state is kept within
	menu, deff body, simple formats, tables, with tt instead of
	pre for terms, as pre isn't allowed in dt, but not in 
	indices.
	simple macros are better handled when texi macros are removed
	or in preformatted sections.
	copying/end copying and insertcopying handled
	@head_lines containing things which should be before the navigation
	panel are used to get the labels for elements.
	first page of index is handled like a normal format
	* Tests/*: more tests for imbrications.
	
2003-04-02  Patrice Dumas <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: footnotes better handled, they have a separated
	stack, state and text.
	footnotes, anchors and refs can be mixed with better results.
	$value{_title}... have only their texinfo expanded during
	pass_texi, including values, macros and so on and the html
	is generated during pass_text.
	* Tests/*: minor changes, more tests.

2003-04-02  Patrice Dumas <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: macros splitted by 3 paragraphs are better handled.
	more isolation of formatting.
	better generation of index keys from commands, with more macros
	replaced by the right letter or symbol.
	better handling of @things{} in preformatted sections.
	preformatted sections handled with a new format, preformatted (similar
	with what is done for paragraphs). Some validation errors avoided.
	commands for tables are handled.
	index entries have the right file/id from their place.
	The files are omitted from hrefs when the href points to the same file.
	* Tests/*: formatting/imbrications.texi added. Sync with code.

2003-03-27  Patrice Dumas <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: rewrite of the parsing of texi
	and of the handling of sectionning.
	pass0 is now pass_texi. It still only generates texinfo.
	pass_texi now also collects informations from sectionning commands
	index entries, printindex commands.
	pass1 through pass4 are now in just one pass, pass_text.
	between pass_texi and pass_text, the information is used to figure
	out the document and indices structure.
	pass_text reparses the texinfo generated by pass_texi and
	produces html. All the formatting is done in isolated subroutines
	such that it is easy to change the formatting witout bothering
	with the parsing.
	pass_text uses scan_line to process a line.
	A stack is used which holds opened macros and formats. Thus the 
	html is always closed and should be valid.
	The document structure seems right with this approach, unnumbered 
	sections are at the right level and indices don't break the document
	structure anymore.
	* Tests/*: more tests for the @macros. Other minor modifications.
	sync with new code.

2003-03-06  Patrice Dumas <pertusus@free.fr>

	* T2h_i18n.pm: added  the licence
	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init, check_texinfo.pl.in: check function
	put in check_texinfo.pl.in. T2H_EXPAND is now an array such that
	more than one type may be expanded
	* texi2html.pl: added a new pass before the other ones, pass0 and
	a function scan_line0 used in that pass. During that pass the
	ifhtml, ifnot*, the comments and multiple empty lines, the macros, 
	values and includes are handled. No html is generated. the
	different things that are expanded can now be within a line and 
	not necessarily at the begining of the line.
	The handling of values and macros is not changed.
	scan_line handles more constructs (newlines (still bugged), 
	verbatim, html and tex, deffn (incomplete)).
	new function close_stack which might be used to close the things 
	forgotten by users or between paragraphs.
	new function substitute_text which uses scan_line to render
	arbitrary text.
	little improvements in menu comments handling.
	accent_map/do_accent should handle all the accents.
	* Tests/test.sh: minor changes.
	* Tests/*: regenerated tests to keep in sync.
	added formatting/imbrications.texi to test for imbricated things.
	* configure, configure.in: added check_texinfo.pl.in.

2003-02-28  Patrice Dumas <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init, T2h_i18n.pm: options specifications
	moved from texi2html.init to texi2html.pl, such that texi2html.init
	resembles a regular user init file. internationalization move
	from texi2html.init to T2h_i18n.pm. 
	* configure.in: added substitution of T2h_i18n.pm within 
	texi2html.pl
	* configure, doc/Makefile.in, Makefile.in, aclocal.m4, 
	Tests/Makefile.in: regenerated with automake-1.6.3, autoconf-2.53

2003-02-24  Patrice Dumas <pertusus@free.fr>

	* Tests: small fixes, more tests showing brokeness of texi2html
	for some features and info and tex differences. 
	A change in texinfo.txi to permit handling of verb despite some 
	substitutions have already been done
	* texi2html.pl: add comment about the formats in texinfo 4.5
	setlocale is used in case of tests to avoid change in ordering of 
	indices while testing against a reference file
	footnotes refs and image handled by parse_line, which calls a 
	sub routine (do_footnote, do_ref or do_image).
	for footnotes, _$doc_num instead of $docu_doc
	appended tp keep track of the file of the footnote, such that it 
	is easier to match. 
	instead of <!--::${section}::--> added before printindex, _$sec_num 
	is appended to printindex, to keep track of the
	section number.
	images extention is taken from the @image tag if available
	everything which was splitted accross pass2, pass3 and pass4 is
	now done in pass2.
	in pass3 only very little cleaning is done, pass4 is removed.

2003-02-21  Patrice Dumas <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: added handling of overbar accent @= is transformed
	in =
	the handling of multi lines macro is done in a function, scan_line
	which scans a line, keeping a record of the text already ready,
	the macro stack and a state which for now only contains 'verb' if in
	@verb macro. The @verb macro is handled by this function (but since
	things have already been substituted, it cannot give the right 
	result easily)

2003-02-19  Patrice Dumas <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: T2H_DEFAULT_button_icon_img behaves
	better when it has some undef arguments
	the variables which may be redefined by the user are now global. 
	They are grouped in texi2html.init, and also in the Declaration in 
	texi2html.pl and sorted by class.
	new elements in %T2H_THISDOC for items which are global but shouldn't
	be redefined by the user (instead of $T2H_HOMEPAGE, $THISPROG...).
	t2h_Init_global has been removed and the code scattered according to
	the principles above
	other minor fixes

2003-02-18  Patrice Dumas <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: handle @verbatim, and @html differently. Added 
	push_until function which shift from a lines array and push to another 
	array until @end tag. Remove PROTECTTAG
	remove unneeded push of index entry for vtable or ftable which
	created 2 indices entry
	* Tests: added more tests

2003-02-13  Patrice Dumas <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: avoid using $_ in functions, as it is a global
	variable, use my variables instead
	* Tests/test.sh: if called with arguments, the test specified by 
	the arguments is the only one done
	* Tests/*: add Makefile.in, more subdirectories, synchronise
	reference files with changes in the code

2003-02-12  Patrice Dumas <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: add prototype for the functions ; remove
	& in front of functions ; remove the unusefull main()
	and Unprotect_texi functions
	* Tests/Makefile.am, Tests/test.sh: add regenerate target to 
	redo the reference files
	add test with tidy, remove cvs/rcs tags when doing diffs

2003-02-11  Patrice Dumas <pertusus@free.fr>

	* Tests/Makefile.am, Tests/test.sh: changes to reflect change
	in directory name for the cvs manual from cvs to ccvs

2003-02-11  Patrice Dumas <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: unused variables removed
	use_bibliography removed, lots of global variables made lexical.
	open renamed open_file to avoid clashing with perl builtin.
	remove sub init_input, the initialization is done in the 
	script itself.
	add meta http-equiv="Content-Type" tag for the charset
 	declaration.

2003-02-06  Patrice Dumas <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: some unused variables removed
	use_acc not used anymore, accents are always handled
	Remove a lot of global variables. Use global lexical or lexically
	scoped variables (with my) when possible. Pass variables as arguments
	when the function is in texi2html.init
	bugfixes: frame target is the top file, and not the toc file
	during pass1 some lines where pushed in @lines2 instead of @lines
	* Tests/test.sh: ignore CVS directory when doing diffs

2003-02-03  Patrice Dumas <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: Remove handling of setref which is a TeX macro. The 
	corresponding texinfo macro is anchor.
	Remove an unneeded protect_texi
	* configure.in, Makefile.am, Tests/test.sh, Tests/Makefile.am Tests/*:
	Files used for testing added, texinfo manuals and the html results for 
	some of the texinfo manuals

2003-01-30  Patrice Dumas <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: fix nesting of multi line style macros (previously,
	@kbd{@code{my
	thing}}
	became
	<kbd>my thing<kbd><code></code> (or something approaching)
	no style substitution is done in indexes (indexes are already good
	html). Added %sec2index which is undef for a section name not in index,
	1 if the section name is in index.
	the value of $docu_doc set if $T2H_OUT was set (option -o) wasn't 
	used to define docu_doc_file, thus the output file was the basename 
	of the texinfo file with extension appended, and not $T2H_OUT.


2003-01-28  Patrice Dumas <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: fixes in the handling of characters which are 
	special in html (&, "), involving some rewriting/replacements

	new function protect_space_style used to normalise nodes without
	calling protect_html

2003-01-24  Patrice Dumas <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: fixes for @multitables:

2003-01-22  Patrice Dumas <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: Ref to info files are handled correctly

	Any character is allowed in menu comments
	In menu, lines begining with * which are not menu entries are allowed
	and treated as comments
	Added a style handle for @bullet (do_bullet) such that @bullet{text}
	is handled
	Cedilla are now accepted in node names. Added protect_cedilla and
	unprotect_cedilla functions.
	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: Add -test option which sets 
	$T2H_TODAY $T2H_USER $THISPROG to given values. This is in order 
	to be able to compare with reference files for testing purproses.

2003-01-16  Patrice Dumas <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: @H{a} is changed in a'' and not &aacute; which was 
	wrong, as there are 2 acute accents on @H{a}.

2003-01-09  Patrice Dumas <pertusus@free.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: Suppress warnings for undefined patterns or 
	variables when running with -w

2000-09-14  Eric Sunshine  <sunshine@sunshineco.com>

	* doc/Makefile.in: Added missing doc/Makefile.in since its absence
	  caused 'configure' and make targets (such as 'distclean') to bomb.

2000-09-14  Olaf Bachmann  <obachman@mathematik.uni-kl.de>

	* applied patches/fixes from  Eric Marsden <emarsden@mail.dotcom.fr>.
	  o DTD now at the beginning of the document
	  o default language to 'en' wasn't working which led to empty LANG=""
	    in <BODY>
	  o missing </FONT> in footer blurb
	  o when the ToC was generated in some cases, the code used
	    <UL></UL> to indent, but didn't have any <LI> tags.  <blockquote>
	    is now used in such cases, instead.

2000-09-11  Eric Sunshine  <sunshine@sunshineco.com>

	* texi2html.pl: Fixed severe macro expansion bug.  Macro argument
	  parsing code did not handle nested braces ('{' and '}') at
	  all, thus valid macro invocations such as
	  "@mymacro{Hello @emph{there} @strong{world}.}" would fail.
	  Prior to this fix, @mymacro would be handed the argument
	  "Hello @emph{there", which is clearly incorrect.  Now @mymacro
	  correctly receives "Hello @emph{there} @strong{world}." as its
	  argument.  This fix also deals properly with the protected brace
	  sequences \{, \}, @{, and @}.

	* texi2html.pl: Fixed severe macro expansion bug.  Macro argument
	  parsing code did not handle arguments split over multiple lines,
	  such as "@mymacro{Hello \n world.}".  Now it correctly handles
	  macro invocations split across any number of lines, and properly
	  flags an error at the correct location if the user forgets the
	  closing brace '}'.

	* texi2html.pl: Fixed formatting errors in expansions of @SPACE,
	  @TAB, and @NL (where SPACE, TAB, and NL represent the actual
	  space, tab, and newline characters).  The Texinfo manual
	  explicitly states that each of these sequences should expand to a
	  "printable" space in the [rendered] output.  The example given in
	  the manual shows that "Spacey@ @ @ @ example" should expand to
	  "Spacey    example".  However, texi2html was only emitting the
	  insignificant whitespace ' ' and '\n' into the HTML output which
	  did not properly preserve the hard spaces in "Spacey    example".
	  Now each of these directives expands to '&nbsp;' instead.

	* texi2html.pl: Made aesthetic improvement to the output of @file{},
	  @option{}, and @samp{}.  The argument string is now quoted with
	  ` and ' _after_ the style has been applied.  For instance,
	  @samp{perl} now expands to "`<samp>perl</samp>'", whereas it used
	  to expand to "<samp>`perl'</samp>".  In my tests, this change
	  results in more aesthetically pleasing rendered output on various
	  browsers.

2000-08-16  Olaf Bachmann  <obachman@mathematik.uni-kl.de>

	* texi2html.pl: Bug fix from: "joseph" <joseph@freenet.de>
	MySimple.pm should be 'require'd, but checked is still texi2html.init.

2000-08-14  Karl Heinz Marbaise   <khmarbaise@gmx.de>
        * new command line switch (Test purposes only!)
          to show new layout in HTML for @def stuff.
        * Texinfo-Documentation updated.
          - New chapter about ``customizing HTML'' started.
          - multiple files instead of one.
          - subdirectory doc.

2000-07-27  Olaf Bachmann  <obachman@mathematik.uni-kl.de>

	* texi2html.pl: Fixed Getopt::Long::Configure("pass_through") for
	older versions of Getopt::Long which do not support his function.

2000-07-11  Olaf Bachmann  <obachman@mathematik.uni-kl.de>

	* implemented @documentlanguage:
	  - sets language of document, unless overwritten by -lang, or 
	    explicitly set $T2H_LANG

	* introduced T2H_OBSOLETE_OPTIONS to prevent obsolete options to 
	  ambiguate current options

2000-07-09  Karl Heinz Marbaise   <khmarbaise@gmx.de>
        * Texinfo-Documentation:
          - fixes from Peter Moulder <pjm@bofh.asn.au> incorporated
            into manual.
          - Updated Manual
            o improved
            o indices for options, variables of script.
            o much more.
        * texi2html.init:
          - improvements for different languages
            (month names, words in different languages).

	Marbaise <khmarbaise@gmx.de> (THANKS!)
	
	* texi2html.1.in: Updates to reflect new cmd-line options

	* Rewrote handling of command-line options:
	- based on (My)Simple.pm, and Getopt::Long
	-help now works and is up-to-date
	-help 1 lists also "not-so-important" options
	-help 2 lists also obsolete options
	- the following options were renamed: (old options still work, but 
	  are marked as obsolete)
	    verbose            ==> Verbose
	    section_navigation ==> sec_nav
	    output_file        ==> out_file
	- the following options are obsoleted (still work, though):
 	    no-section_navigation ==> -nosec_nav
	    use_acc		  ==> ALWAYS use accents
	    expandinfo		  ==> -expand info	
	    expandtex		  ==> -expand tex
	    no_verbose            ==> default case
	    monolithic            ==> default case
	    split_node            ==> -split section
	    split_chapter         ==> -split chapter
	
2000-06-27  Olaf Bachmann  <obachman@mathematik.uni-kl.de>

	* Fixed bug in anchor generation (reported by various people who
	noticed that @anchor may not be on one line with @item)
	* Fixed infinite loop on missing '@end macro'
	* texi2html.pl: -expandinfo and -expandtex command-line options
	for backward compatibility

	* texi2html.init: Use ISO 639 language codes for keys in $T2H_LANG 
	hash.

2000-06-26  Olaf Bachmann  <obachman@mathematik.uni-kl.de>

	* texi2html.pl: new command-line options:
	 -nonumber, -nomenu to unset the default -number -menu

	* texi2html.pl: As suggested by "Richard Y. Kim" <ryk@coho.net>:
	insert <A NAME="#nodename"></A> for each
	nodename in a document (nodename is exactly as in texinfo
	source). 
	
	* From: "Richard Y. Kim" <ryk@coho.net>
	  o $T2H_FRAMES internal boolean variable which defaults to 0
	  o -frames command line option which changes $T2H_FRAMES to 1.
	  o If $T2H_FRAMES is 1, then two additional files are output.
	    If mydoc.html is output normally, then mydoc_frame.html
	    and mydoc_frame_toc.html files are output.
	  o The functions T2H_print_frame, and T2H_print_toc_frame are used to
		generate contents of these files.
	  o The T2H_DEFAULT_print_frame and T2H_DEFAULT_print_toc_frame
	    (defined in texi2html.ini) do the following:
       mydoc_frame.html is the short file with <FRAME> tags.
       mydoc_frame_toc.html is basically the short table of contents
       which goes on the narrow left frame.
	
	* texi2html.pl: @,{c} --> &ccedil;

	    o handle \} in macro arguments
	* from brlewis@alum.mit.edu:
	    o Changes to facilitate CSS
	    o -toc_file option for those who want the TOC to be index.html
	    o Config variable $T2H_HREF_DIR_INSTEAD_FILE:
	       if set (e.g., to index.html) replace hrefs to this file 
               (i.e., to index.html) by ./
	* texi2html.pl: index generation after value substitution

2000-05-31  Olaf Bachmann  <obachman@mathematik.uni-kl.de>

	* texi2html.pl: for def_map stuff <A NAME=..> before output
	* texi2html.pl: applied patch from "Richard Y. Kim" <ryk@ap.com>
	                for @refs with 2 or 3 args: use 3rd or 2nd argor
			section (in that order) as text for reference.

	argument.

2000-04-08  Peter Moulder  <pjm@bofh.asn.au>

	* Makefile.am, configure.in: Generate texi2html in

	* texi2html.pl: $docu_top=$T2H_TOP_FILE || $docu_name. $docu_ext;

2000-03-31  Olaf Bachmann  <obachman@mathematik.uni-kl.de>

	* texi2html.pl: $complex_format_map for complex enclosing

	(@example, @format, @display, etc).
	* Release version 1.61.

2000-03-29  Olaf Bachmann  <obachman@mathematik.uni-kl.de>

	* Cleaned up texi2html.pl and added loading of init file (when
	texi2html.pl is run) such that it can directly be used as script
	(otherwise, debugging is much harder).

	* fixed getpwuid 

	* Added T2H_print_chapter_header, T2H_print_chapter_footer for
	more fine-grained control of T2H_SPLIT eq 'chapter', added option
	-section_navigation, $T2H_SECTION_NAVIGATION to suppress output of
	navigation panels per section

	* Changed naming and and calling convention of customizable subs:
	They all have prefix T2H_, are called with &$T2H_, are assigned by 
	$T2H_<name> = \&T2H_DEFAULT_<name>.

	* texi2html.init: Incorporated changed of Peter Moulder:
	
2000-03-27  Olaf Bachmann  <obachman@mathematik.uni-kl.de>

	* debian/*: deleted
	* texi2html.pl: Incorporated changes of Peter Moulder
	* texi2html.pl: Automatic node pointer creation added
	* texi2html.pl: @enddots, @exclamdown, etc added

2000-03-26  Peter Moulder  <reiter@netspace.net.au>

	* texi2html.init: Address a couple of weblint/tidy warnings.

	* texi2html.init:
	* texi2html.pl: The init file is inserted into the executable at
	build time (see Makefile.am).

	* texi2html.pl: Source each of @sysconfdir@/texi2htmlrc and
	$HOME/.texi2htmlrc if it exists, after processing texi2html.init
	but before anything on the command-line.
	
	Allow -split_chapter, -split_node, -monolithic options, which is
	what previous versions of texi2html used.
	
	Support `@command{...}'.
	
	Add --help, --version options.
	
	-sidx isn't used, so comment out.

	* configure.in:
	* Makefile.am:
	* autogen.sh: New files.

	* configure.in: Change version number from 1.60Beta to 1.59.2.

	* debian/*: New files.

	* texi2html.1.in:
	* texi2html.pl: Extract the man page into a separate file.  At the
	moment, the man page is even installed separately (with
	texi2html.pl having `.so @MANPAGE_PATH@' in place of the
	manpage).  Conceivably we could add a configure option to
	construct everything as one file like we used to; just replace
	that text with `@EMBEDDED_MANPAGE@', which would be replaced with
	either the existing `.so @MANPAGE_PATH@' or with texi2html.1
	contents the way texi2html.init is done.
	
2000-03-14  Olaf Bachmann  <obachman@mathematik.uni-kl.de>

	* texi2html.pl: center @image by default, can be overwritten by
	T2H_CENTER_IMAGE (sunshine@sunshineco.com)
