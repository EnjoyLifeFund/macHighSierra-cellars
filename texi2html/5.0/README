This is the README file for the texi2html distribution.
The primary distribution point is
http://savannah.nongnu.org/download/texi2html/

Installation
============

For generic installation instructions on compiling and installing this
Automake-based distribution, please read the file `INSTALL'.
Installation notes specific to Texi2html:
* Installation is fairly simple, no compilers are required.
* You need to have perl version 5.00405, or higher installed 
  on your system to run 'texi2html'. To play nice with encodings you 
  need the Encode and Unicode::Normalize modules. It is likely that an
  older perl 5 version also works if File::Spec is present.
* To generate Makefile.in etc., run `./autogen.sh' or autoreconf

Getting Started with texi2html
==============================

'texi2html' converts texinfo documents to HTML, Info, docbook
and XML.

Texinfo is the official documentation format of the GNU project. It
uses a single source file to produce both on-line information and
printed output. For more details about texinfo, see
http://www.texinfo.org. 

Te HTML output of 'texi2html' is highly configurable. Among others, 
with 'texi2html' you can customize your entire page layout (like 
headers, footers, style sheets, etc), split documents at various levels 
and use 'latex2html' to convert @tex sections.

Because if this configurability, texi2html is being integrated into
the texinfo GNU project at http://www.texinfo.org. The projects 
are already being merged, and the 5.0 release is likely to be the last 
release of a separate texi2html.

To create HTML of texinfo documents
===================================

Make sure that you have 'texi2html' correctly installed on your
system. The general synopsis of 'texi2html' is

    texi2html [options] texinfo-source-file

Without any options, this will create the file <docname>.html where 
<docname> is the basename of your texinfo files.

Run 'texi2html -h' for a short overview of the most important options,
or have a look at the texi2html man page. For more in-depth information
see the texi2html texinfo manual.

Customizing texi2html
=====================

Initialisation options are read first from
'/usr/local/etc/texi2html/Config' (the exact location being changeable with
the '--sysconfdir=dir' option to the configure script), then from
$HOME/.texi2html/Config, then any command-line options including --init-file
options; with later settings overriding earlier ones.

The default initialisation options are defined in the
'texi2html.init' and built-in formats files in formats/*.init files 
contained in the Texi2html distribution (in fact, a script pastes 
those files into the beginning of the perl file generated by 
`./configure' from texi2html.pl and generates the actual 'texi2html' 
script this way.).

To customize 'texi2html' it is best if you copy the appropriate
sections from the 'texi2html.init' file into an appropriate local
initialization file, make the necessary changes there, and then have
'texi2html' read this initialisation file by one of the means described
above.

For an example on what you can produce with 'texi2html' have a look
at the following sites:

* http://www.singular.uni-kl.de/Manual/html/

(Please send me your sites, if you'd like to have them listed here).

Documentation of texi2html
==========================

The texi2html Texinfo manual is lagging behind the development. In 
addition, you might want to have a look at the comments in the 
'texi2html.init' file for explanations about customizable parameters 
and at the (not up-to-date) texi2html man page for an overview of 
texi2html's synopsis.

More information
================

Texi2html's home page can be found at http://www.nongnu.org/texi2html/
The home for development was at savannah at
http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/texi2html
and is being merged into 
http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/texinfo

The newest version of Texi2html can be obtained from
http://savannah.nongnu.org/download/texi2html/
or, via anonymous cvs (see
http://savannah.gnu.org/cvs/?group=texinfo for instructions).
The texi2html tree is in the texinfo tree, in the texi2html
directory.

Reporting bugs
==============

For bug reports, please include enough information for the maintainers
to reproduce the problem.  Generally speaking, that means:
- the version number of Texi2html and the program(s) involved (use --version).
- the contents of any input files necessary to reproduce the bug (crucial!).
- a description of the problem and any samples of the erroneous output.
- anything else that you think would be helpful.

Patches are most welcome; if possible, please make them against the
source files (e.g., against texi2html.pl, or texi2html.init) with
`diff -c' or `diff -u' and include ChangeLog entries.

Good luck and enjoy !!
