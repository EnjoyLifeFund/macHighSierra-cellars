XML-COREUTILS README

PURPOSE

xml-coreutils is a set of command line utilities which mimic (where
applicable) the GNU coreutils in functionality and interface, while 
operating on XML documents. See the documents in the doc/ directory 
for a comprehensive explanation.

LICENSE

The xml-coreutils are distributed under the terms of the GNU General
Public License (GPL) version 3 or later (at your option), which can be
found in the file named COPYING.

BUILDING

The usual build instructions apply, e.g. from within the top level
xml-coreutils directory (which contains the configure script), type

./configure
make
make check
make install

You need root privileges for the last command, unless you chose a
nonstandard installation prefix, e.g. with the command

./configure --prefix=/home/username/local

RUNNING

The xml-coreutils each have a man page which explains usage, and
there is also a section 7 man page for xml-coreutils, which incidentally
lists all available commands.

man xml-cat
man 7 xml-coreutils
