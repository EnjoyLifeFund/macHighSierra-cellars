.SH SYNOPSIS
.HP
.B xml-unecho 
.RI [ OPTION ]...
.R [
.RI [ FILE ]
.RI [: XPATH ]...
.R ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B xml-unecho
reads an XML file and transforms it into a string which
is in the format used by 
.BR xml-echo (1). 
It is intended that 
if 
.BR xml-echo (1)
processes this string, the output should be 
equivalent to the original FILE.
.PP
As an important exception, if the --xml-sed option is used, then
each line of output shows the pattern space as seen by 
.BR xml-sed (1)
during
processing. This can be useful if you need to understand an 
.BR xml-sed (1)
script.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP --xml-sed
print echo-leaves as seen and processed by xml-sed.
.SH EXIT STATUS
xml-unecho returns 0 on success, or 1 otherwise.
